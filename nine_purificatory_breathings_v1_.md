Here’s ། རླུང་རོ་བསལ་པ། rendered in Uchen (dbu-can) Tibetan script.

This rendering faithfully reflects the transliterated phrase “rlung ro bsal ba”—often understood in its ritual context as "Expelling the Dead Rlung." If you’d like to delve deeper into its meaning, usage in devotional practices, or explore a calligraphic representation, let’s continue the discussion.


I understand 'ro' denotes a corpse, so "corpse breath"?

You're on the right track. In the Tibetan phrase "rlung ro bsal ba," the syllable "ro" indeed denotes "corpse" or "dead." Given that "rlung" translates as "wind" or "breath," a literal reading is "corpse breath" or "corpse wind." However, Tibetan tantric terminology is rarely straightforward—a word-for-word translation often only scratches the surface.

In esoteric Tibetan contexts, terms like these are loaded with symbolism. The "corpse" isn't merely a reference to a dead body; it can also evoke themes of impermanence, dissolution, and the raw transformative energy that comes with letting go of attachment. So the idea of "expelling the corpse breath" isn't about literal decay but about purging the stagnant or impure energies that block spiritual clarity. Rituals using this terminology might be aimed at clearing these obstructive forces from the subtle body, paving the way for transformation and enlightenment.

Is this layered symbolism in Tibetan ritual language something you’re exploring in your research or creative work? There are rich layers to unpack here—perhaps we could delve deeper into the symbolic interplay between physical decay and transformative spirituality in Tibetan thought.



Below is a detailed survey of the Tibetan compound rlung ro dgu phrugs—breaking down its lexical components, grammatical structure, semantic layers, polysemy, and etymological background.

1. Lexical Components

- rlung (རླུང་):  
  This is a well‐established Tibetan noun meaning “wind” or “breath.” In everyday usage it denotes the physical air or breath, but in yogic and tantric contexts it is the subtle energy (comparable to Sanskrit prāṇa). As such, rlung occupies a central place in Tibetan medicine and meditative practices, referring to the life force that circulates through the body’s channels

- ro (རོ):  
  Literally meaning “corpse” or “dead body,” ro is a common Tibetan lexeme that carries not only a physical sense but also deep symbolic connotations. Within ritual language, the corpse is not seen merely as a decaying body—it often stands as an emblem of impermanence and the residue of past states or karmic accumulations. In many ritual formulations (e.g., those dealing with expulsion of unwholesome energies), marking a term with ro singles it out as pertaining to the impure or stale.

- dgu (དགུ་):  
  In Tibetan, dgu is a verbal root whose basic meaning is “to expel,” “to drive out,” or “to scatter.” It suggests a forceful movement or the act of thrusting something away. In ritual texts where purification is at stake, dgu underlines an active process—a deliberate expulsion of energies that no longer serve the body–mind system.

- phrugs (ཕྲུགས་):  
  Often paired with a root such as dgu, phrugs can be understood as a resultative or nominalizing form that conveys the completed state or process of expulsion. Together with dgu, the compound signals not only the action (“to expel”) but also its finished or transformative outcome. In ritual language, the pairing emphasizes that a particular “wind” is actively being dissipated or cleared away.

2. Grammatical and Compound Structure

Tibetan is an agglutinative language, and compounds are constructed by placing modifiers after a head noun. In rlung ro dgu phrugs, the structure unfolds as follows:

- Head:  
  rlung is the principal noun.

- Modifier 1 – Qualificatory Marker:  
  ro follows as an attributive element that qualifies rlung as “corpse wind” or “dead wind.” In this usage, ro does not merely denote a literal corpse but imbues the wind with qualities of decay or stagnation in a ritual context.

- Modifier 2 – Verbal Process:  
  The compound dgu phrugs functions as an adjectival or verbal modifier describing the dynamic action applied to the head noun. It communicates the process by which the “corpse wind” is expelled, dispersed, or cleared away from the subtle body. The pairing can be seen as a compact expression of both a verb (“to expel”) and its result (the state of having been expelled).

This head–modifier formation is typical of Tibetan compounds, where little is said explicitly; many of the nuances must be inferred from the context and ritual framework.

3. Semantic Range and Polysemy

Each element of the phrase maintains multiple layers of meaning that interact to give a rich, symbolic narrative:

- Rlung:  
  Semantically, rlung is polysemic. On one level, it is the breath or wind that is essential for life; on another, it is a subtle energy coursing through the channels (rtsa) of the body. Its role in meditation and tantric practice defines it as both a natural phenomenon and a refined instrument of spiritual transformation.

- Ro:  
  While it literally means “corpse,” in ritual and tantric terminology the term encapsulates the concept of what is no longer vital or the residue of past attachments. In the context of expelling forces, it underlines the need to clear what is inert or spiritually “dead” in order to make way for renewal.

- Dgu Phrugs:  
  Together these words invite dual readings. They denote the physical act of expulsion (a dynamic, cleansing outflow) and simultaneously hint at an inner psychic purging. The expulsion isn’t simply a removal—it is transformative, ensuring that stagnated or decayed energies do not impede spiritual progress. The polysemy here lies in bridging the tangible (expelling physical waste or decay) with the intangible (clearing mental or subtle-bodily blockages).

Thus, the full compound can be understood literally as “the expulsion (dgu phrugs) of the corpse (ro) wind (rlung)” and, more symbolically, as a description of a ritual process where stale or impure energies (marked by the imagery of a corpse) are actively dispersed to allow for spiritual rejuvenation.

4. Etymological Considerations

- Rlung:  
  Its etymological roots lie deep in the Tibetan language, but its close parallel to Sanskrit prāṇa reveals shared Indo-Tibetan conceptions of life energy. Over time, rlung has branched into a number of specialized meanings, both in everyday language (air, wind) and in spiritual literature (subtle energy).

- Ro:  
  A native Tibetan word, ro has been used in multiple idiomatic and philosophical contexts. In ritual contexts, its connection with death and decay transcends physical mortality, serving instead as a marker of that which is spiritually obsolete. This dual life—as an everyday term and a loaded ritual signifier—demonstrates the deep symbolic economy of Tibetan vocabulary.

- Dgu and Phrugs:  
  Though less frequently encountered outside specialized ritual texts, these elements reveal a typical Tibetan pattern where a verbal root (dgu) is supplemented by a complement (phrugs) that emphasizes either intensity or completion. Their formation reflects grammatical patterns in Middle and Classical Tibetan, where the process of expulsion (whether physical, energetic, or karmic) is central to both medical and tantric practices.

5. Contextual and Ritual Implications

In Tibetan ritual literature and meditative practice, phrases like rlung ro dgu phrugs are not isolated technical terms but are woven into a broader symbolic framework. They appear in texts and practices concerned with the purification of the subtle body, where stagnant or “corpse” energies (representing untransformed karmic residues) are actively expelled to clear the path for enlightened awareness. This process is essential in tantric systems of transformation, where physical processes and subtle energies mirror one another.  

The dual reference—to the physical (a corpse, the wind of the body) and the spiritual (the subtle energies that need purification)—epitomizes Tibetan esoteric thought, which habitually fuses the mundane with the profound [^2^][^3^].

In Summary

- Lexically:  
  - rlung means “wind/breath” (both physical and subtle energy).  
  - ro means “corpse” and qualifies that wind as stagnant or dead in nature.  
  - dgu phrugs denotes the act and result of expelling or dispersing, implying a cleansing operation.

- Grammatically:  
  The compound is constructed in a head–modifier pattern common to Tibetan, where the head noun (rlung) is defined by following adjectives and verbal modifiers.

- Semantically:  
  The phrase works on multiple levels—a literal description and a rich metaphor for the purgative processes in Tibetan yogic and tantric practice.

- Etymologically:  
  While rlung shares roots with the Sanskrit conception of life force, ro and the compound dgu phrugs demonstrate Tibetan innovations in using everyday terminology for profound ritual practices.

This survey is by no means exhaustive but captures the primary layers of meaning and usage intrinsic to rlung ro dgu phrugs. Such compounds remind us of the elegance with which Tibetan language fuses the elemental with the mystical—a linguistic shorthand for complex inner processes.
