Here’s ། རླུང་རོ་བསལ་པ། rendered in Uchen (dbu-can) Tibetan script.

This rendering faithfully reflects the transliterated phrase “rlung ro bsal ba”—often understood in its ritual context as "Expelling the Dead Rlung." If you’d like to delve deeper into its meaning, usage in devotional practices, or explore a calligraphic representation, let’s continue the discussion.


I understand 'ro' denotes a corpse, so "corpse breath"?

You're on the right track. In the Tibetan phrase "rlung ro bsal ba," the syllable "ro" indeed denotes "corpse" or "dead." Given that "rlung" translates as "wind" or "breath," a literal reading is "corpse breath" or "corpse wind." However, Tibetan tantric terminology is rarely straightforward—a word-for-word translation often only scratches the surface.

In esoteric Tibetan contexts, terms like these are loaded with symbolism. The "corpse" isn't merely a reference to a dead body; it can also evoke themes of impermanence, dissolution, and the raw transformative energy that comes with letting go of attachment. So the idea of "expelling the corpse breath" isn't about literal decay but about purging the stagnant or impure energies that block spiritual clarity. Rituals using this terminology might be aimed at clearing these obstructive forces from the subtle body, paving the way for transformation and enlightenment.

Is this layered symbolism in Tibetan ritual language something you’re exploring in your research or creative work? There are rich layers to unpack here—perhaps we could delve deeper into the symbolic interplay between physical decay and transformative spirituality in Tibetan thought.
