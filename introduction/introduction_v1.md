## Bright and Murk ##

Long ago, in my mid-twenties, when I was reading works on Jungian 'Shadow Work' and actually doing the Work, I came across a well-written, astute and evocative writer, who used 'bright side' and 'murk side', throughout their work. It vexes me as I do not remember the author(s) or the work, but it profoundly moved me and has stayed with ne all these years. I have written of it in other works. Both of the terms 'bright' and 'murk' are Germanic in origin and have deeper roots. I didn't know that then, but I know it now. For me, this holds import. I use the terms and concepts bright-stave and murk-stave in my runework. Which, to my knowledge, has roots in the work of Thorsson (1999, 1988), a *nom-de-plume* for Flowers, who likely came by these terms in mediaeval or pre-modern Icelandic, Swedish, Germanic runelore or other writings, grimoire or folk-traditions.


Let’s start with “bright”:

Etymology:"Bright" comes from the Old English beorht (also found as bryht in metathesized forms), meaning “radiating or reflecting light” as well as “splendid” or “beautiful.” This Old English word is inherited from the Proto-Germanic *berhtaz, which in turn derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *bhereg- meaning “to shine; bright, white.” Over time, the word not only came to describe physical light but also was used metaphorically for mental quickness or brilliance (the figurative sense of “quick-witted” appears much later, around the mid-18th century).

First Attestation:The adjective appears in Old English texts — the form “beorht” (or its metathesized variant “bryht”) is attested in early medieval literature. Although exact dates in the Old English period are not always specified in modern etymological entries, “bright” in its original sense is well attested in Old English sources from the early medieval period .

Now for “murk”:

Etymology:"Murk" comes from Middle English mirke (or alternatively spelled “mirk”), itself derived from Old Norse myrkr, meaning “darkness” or “gloom.” This word ultimately comes from Proto-Germanic *merkwjo- (or similar forms), and is linked through related words in several Germanic languages. The Proto-Indo-European root *mergʰ- is posited to mean “to flicker; to darken; to be dark” .

First Attestation:The noun “murk,” meaning “gloom” or “darkness,” is first attested around c. 1300. In Middle English it was used both as a noun and, later, as an adjective. The word often appeared in literary and descriptive contexts to evoke the sense of a dark, gloomy environment. The term “mirk” remains common as a variant, especially in Scottish usage, and in poetic language “murkiness” continues to be a recognized term for deep darkness .

These origins not only reveal the linguistic roots of common descriptors but also show how words evolve to encompass broader metaphorical meanings with cultural usage over time.

# Śāntarasa: The Contentious Ninth Rasa - A Comprehensive Investigation

## Introduction

The concept of Śāntarasa (शान्तरस) represents one of the most debated topics in Sanskrit literary aesthetics, generating sustained scholarly controversy for over a millennium[1]. This ninth rasa, characterized by tranquility and spiritual detachment, challenges fundamental assumptions about emotional representation in dramatic and poetic arts[2].

## Etymology and Linguistic Analysis

### Sanskrit Terminology

**Śāntarasa** (शान्तरस)
- **Devanagari**: शान्तरस
- **IAST**: śāntarasa  
- **Root Etymology**: From śam (शम्) meaning "to calm, pacify" + rasa (रस) meaning "flavor, essence"[3]
- **Pronunciation**: [ˈɕaːntə.rəsə] (śāntarasa)[4]

The compound śāntarasa literally translates as "the flavor of peace" or "the aesthetic experience of tranquility"[1]. The root śam derives from the verbal root √śam (शम्-शमने) meaning "to calm, to pacify," which forms the basis for related terms[3].

### Related Key Terms

**Śama** (शम)
- **Devanagari**: शम
- **IAST**: śama
- **Definition**: Impassivity, equanimity, the stable emotional state underlying śāntarasa[1][5]
- **Etymology**: Directly from √śam, representing the permanent emotional disposition (sthāyibhāva) of śāntarasa[6]

**Vairāgya** (वैराग्य)
- **Devanagari**: वैराग्य  
- **IAST**: vairāgya
- **Definition**: Detachment, dispassion arising from spiritual knowledge[7][6]
- **Etymology**: From vi- (वि) "without" + rāga (राग) "attachment, passion"[8]

**Nirveda** (निर्वेद)
- **Devanagari**: निर्वेद
- **IAST**: nirveda  
- **Definition**: Despondency, indifference toward worldly experiences leading to spiritual insight[9][10]
- **Etymology**: From nir- (निर्) "without" + veda (वेद) "knowledge," implying transcendence of ordinary cognition[11]

## Historical Development and First Attestations

### Pre-Bharata Period

While Bharata Muni's Nāṭyaśāstra (dating between 500 BCE to 500 CE) systematically outlined eight rasas, some scholars suggest that śāntarasa concepts existed in earlier traditions[1][12]. The antiquity of the Nāṭyaśāstra itself remains contested, with estimates varying significantly across this millennium-long timespan[13].

### Bharata's Original Framework

Bharata Muni established eight primary rasas in the Nāṭyaśāstra: śṛṅgāra (erotic), hāsya (comic), karuṇa (pathetic), raudra (furious), vīra (heroic), bhayānaka (terrible), bībhatsa (odious), and adbhuta (marvelous)[12][14]. Significantly, śāntarasa was deliberately excluded from this canonical list[15][16].

### Udbhaṭa's Innovation (Late 8th Century CE)

The first systematic recognition of śāntarasa as the ninth rasa is attributed to Udbhaṭa (750-810 CE), a court scholar of King Jayāpīḍa of Kashmir[1][17]. In his Kāvyālaṅkāra-sāra-saṅgraha, Udbhaṭa elaborately discussed nine rasas, marking the formal introduction of śāntarasa into poetic theory[18][19].

### Ānandavardhana's Contribution (9th Century CE)

Ānandavardhana (9th century CE) in his seminal Dhvanyāloka provided crucial theoretical support for śāntarasa[20][21]. He argued that śāntarasa constitutes the predominant aesthetic flavor in both the Mahābhārata and Rāmāyaṇa, fundamentally challenging previous interpretations of these epics[11][6].

### Abhinavagupta's Synthesis (10th-11th Century CE)

Abhinavagupta (975-1025 CE), the towering Kashmir Śaivite philosopher, provided the most sophisticated defense of śāntarasa in his Abhinavabhāratī commentary on the Nāṭyaśāstra[22][23]. He characterized śāntarasa as the fundamental essence underlying all other rasas, comparing it to Śiva as the supreme principle among the eight gods representing the traditional rasas[22].

## Points of Contention

### Primary Arguments Against Śāntarasa

#### The Sthāyibhāva Problem

Critics, including followers of Bharata's orthodox interpretation, argue that śāntarasa cannot qualify as a legitimate rasa because its sthāyibhāva (permanent emotional state) is detachment (vairāgya) rather than a positive emotional disposition[11]. This fundamental objection holds that aesthetic experience requires active emotional engagement, not the cessation of emotion[2].

#### Theatrical Impossibility

Prominent theorists like Bhaṭṭa Prabhākara contended that śāntarasa cannot be effectively portrayed in dramatic performance[24]. The argument maintains that representing complete detachment from worldly desires is practically impossible on stage, where actors must embody specific characters and situations[2]. This criticism questions whether true spiritual transcendence can be aesthetically realized through mimetic representation.

#### Bharata's Authority

Orthodox scholars invoke Bharata's original authority, arguing that since the foundational text of Indian dramaturgy recognized only eight rasas, later additions lack scriptural sanction[15][16]. This position treats the Nāṭyaśāstra as definitive, rejecting subsequent innovations as unauthorized departures from canonical wisdom.

### Arguments Supporting Śāntarasa

#### Abhinavagupta's Refutation

Abhinavagupta systematically addressed these objections through several key arguments[16][22]:

1. **Aesthetic Analogy**: Just as śṛṅgāra rasa doesn't require actual sexual intercourse on stage, śāntarasa doesn't demand literal spiritual realization but rather the artistic representation of transcendental aspiration[2].

2. **Implicit Recognition**: Bharata had already indicated śāntarasa's validity within the Nāṭyaśāstra, even without explicit nomenclature[25].

3. **Supreme Integration**: Śāntarasa serves as the foundational state from which all other rasas emerge and into which they ultimately resolve[22].

#### Ānandavardhana's Epic Analysis

Ānandavardhana's interpretation of the Mahābhārata and Rāmāyaṇa as fundamentally śāntarasa-dominant provided textual evidence for the concept's literary validity[11][6]. He argued that both epics ultimately emphasize the attainment of peace and spiritual resolution rather than the temporary emotional states represented by other rasas.

#### Buddhist and Jaina Influence

V. Raghavan and other scholars suggest that the development of śāntarasa reflected the influence of Buddhist and Jaina literary traditions, where spiritual detachment and liberation constituted central aesthetic themes[17]. Works like Aśvaghoṣa's Buddhacarita exemplified how soteriological narratives could sustain dramatic interest from beginning to end[25].

### Contemporary Scholarly Positions

#### Gary Tubb's Interpretation

Modern scholar Gary Tubb offers a nuanced perspective, suggesting that śāntarasa's "pleasure derived from the cessation of desire" should be understood as an emotional state intended for the audience rather than experienced by dramatic characters[11]. This interpretation resolves the theatrical impossibility objection while preserving the concept's aesthetic validity.

#### Sheldon Pollock's Analysis

Sheldon Pollock observes the paradox that śāntarasa emerged despite most religious poetry being "based on the passion and desire of God and not about dispassion"[2]. He notes Mammaṭa's distinction that divine-directed desire constitutes emotion (bhāva) rather than rasa, highlighting the complex relationship between devotional and aesthetic experience.

## Theoretical Framework and Components

### Sthāyibhāva: Sama

The permanent emotional state underlying śāntarasa is sama (शम), characterized by impassivity and equanimity[1][6]. This differs fundamentally from the more dynamic sthāyibhāvas of other rasas, representing a state of emotional equilibrium rather than specific affective arousal.

### Vibhāva (Excitants)

The determinant factors (vibhāva) that evoke śāntarasa include[26]:
- Study of Upaniṣadic texts
- Association with wise souls and spiritual teachers  
- Residence in solitary places conducive to contemplation
- Witnessing the cosmic form (virāṭ-rūpa) of divinity
- Philosophical discourse on the nature of reality

### Anubhāva (Consequents)

The external manifestations (anubhāva) of śāntarasa comprise[27]:
- Peaceful facial expression
- Half-closed or upward-turned eyes suggesting meditation
- Controlled breathing and composed posture
- Gentle speech patterns
- Absence of agitated movement

### Vyabhicāribhāva (Transitory States)

The ancillary emotions (vyabhicāribhāva) supporting śāntarasa include[24]:
- Dhṛti (steadfastness, patience)
- Smṛti (remembrance of spiritual truths)
- Tuṣṭi (contentment)
- Unmāda (transcendental absorption)
- Nidrā (meditative rest)

## Relationship to Bhakti Rasa

### Rūpa Gosvāmī's Innovation

In the 16th century, Rūpa Gosvāmī revolutionized rasa theory by proposing bhakti-rasa as the supreme aesthetic experience[16][28]. His Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu identified five primary devotional rasas, with śānta-rasa representing the foundational relationship of neutral reverence toward the divine[29][30].

### Gaudīya Vaiṣṇava Perspective

Within Gaudīya Vaiṣṇava theology, śānta-rasa occupies a unique position as the starting point for more intimate devotional relationships[26]. However, practitioners note that "there is no śānta-rasa in Vraja," emphasizing the transcendence of even peaceful detachment in the realm of spontaneous divine love[26].

## Chronological Timeline of Development

| Period | Development | Key Figures |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 500 BCE - 500 CE | Bharata's Nāṭyaśāstra establishes eight rasas, excludes śāntarasa | Bharata Muni |
| Late 8th Century CE | First systematic recognition of śāntarasa as ninth rasa | Udbhaṭa |
| 9th Century CE | Theoretical elaboration and epic interpretation | Ānandavardhana |
| 10th-11th Century CE | Philosophical synthesis and Kashmir Śaivite integration | Abhinavagupta |
| 11th Century CE | Consolidation in mainstream poetics | Mammaṭa |
| 16th Century CE | Devotional reinterpretation and bhakti-rasa development | Rūpa Gosvāmī |

## Contemporary Relevance and Debate

### Modern Performance Practice

Contemporary practitioners of Indian classical arts continue to grapple with śāntarasa's representation[10]. Unlike other rasas with clear gestural vocabularies, śāntarasa requires subtle embodiment of spiritual states, challenging conventional dramatic techniques.

### Academic Discourse

Modern Sanskrit scholarship remains divided on śāntarasa's legitimacy and significance[31]. Some scholars view it as a necessary completion of emotional taxonomy, while others consider it an artificial addition that compromises the integrity of Bharata's original system.

## Conclusion

The controversy surrounding śāntarasa reflects deeper tensions within Indian aesthetic theory between emotional engagement and spiritual transcendence[2]. While critics question its theatrical viability and scriptural authority, supporters argue for its philosophical necessity and textual evidence[22]. This ongoing debate illuminates the dynamic relationship between artistic representation and spiritual aspiration that characterizes much of Sanskrit literary culture[20]. The concept's evolution from Udbhaṭa's initial formulation through Abhinavagupta's sophisticated defense to Rūpa Gosvāmī's devotional reinterpretation demonstrates the continued vitality of rasa theory as a framework for understanding aesthetic and spiritual experience[1][16][28].

The persistence of scholarly disagreement after more than a millennium indicates that śāntarasa touches upon fundamental questions about the nature of aesthetic experience, the relationship between art and spirituality, and the boundaries of dramatic representation that remain relevant to contemporary discussions of literature and performance[2][11].

# Bhāva Theory: A Comprehensive Investigation

## Introduction

Bhāva theory represents one of the foundational pillars of Sanskrit aesthetic philosophy, serving as the essential counterpart to Rasa theory in Indian dramaturgy and poetics[1]. While Rasa theory concerns itself with the aesthetic emotions experienced by the audience, Bhāva theory focuses on the emotional states that are portrayed by performers and characters, forming the psychological infrastructure that enables the manifestation of Rasa[2]. This comprehensive investigation explores the etymological roots, historical development, theoretical framework, and contemporary relevance of Bhāva theory, examining its intricate relationship with Rasa while maintaining focus on its distinct conceptual identity[3].

## Etymology and Linguistic Analysis

### Sanskrit Terminology

**Bhāva** (भाव)
- **Devanagari**: भाव
- **IAST**: bhāva
- **Root Etymology**: From the Sanskrit verbal root √bhū (भू) meaning "to become, to exist, to occur"[4]
- **Pronunciation**: [ˈbʱaːvə] (bhāva)

The term bhāva literally translates as "state of being" or "becoming," reflecting its fundamental connection to existence and manifestation[5]. The root √bhū (भू) is one of the most significant verbal roots in Sanskrit, appearing in numerous philosophical contexts related to ontology and phenomenology[6]. This etymological foundation reveals that bhāva is not merely an emotion but a complete state of being that manifests through expression[7].

### Semantic Range

The semantic field of bhāva encompasses several interconnected meanings:
- Emotional state or mood
- Mental disposition
- Manner of being or existing
- Process of becoming
- Intention or purport
- Inner feeling that seeks outward expression[8]

This semantic richness demonstrates why bhāva became the central concept for understanding the psychological dimensions of dramatic representation in Sanskrit aesthetics[9]. The term conveys both the internal emotional state and its external manifestation, bridging the gap between subjective experience and objective expression[10].

## Historical Development

### Pre-Bharata Origins

While Bharata's Nāṭyaśāstra provides the first systematic exposition of bhāva theory, the concept has deeper roots in Vedic literature and early Indian thought[11]. References to emotional states and their expression can be found in the Upaniṣads, where various mental dispositions are discussed in relation to spiritual practice[12]. The development of bhāva as an aesthetic concept likely emerged gradually from these earlier philosophical discussions about human psychology and expression[13].

### Bharata's Codification (c. 200 BCE - 200 CE)

The formal articulation of bhāva theory appears in Bharata Muni's Nāṭyaśāstra, particularly in the sixth and seventh chapters known as the Rasādhyāya and Bhāvādhyāya respectively[8]. In this seminal text, Bharata identifies forty-nine distinct bhāvas, categorizing them into three primary types: sthāyibhāva (permanent emotions), vyabhicāribhāva (transitory emotions), and sāttvikabhāva (involuntary physical responses)[5]. This tripartite classification established the fundamental framework for understanding emotional expression in Sanskrit dramaturgy[1].

### Post-Bharata Developments (3rd-8th centuries CE)

Following Bharata, several commentators expanded and refined bhāva theory:

- **Udbhaṭa** (late 8th century CE) elaborated on the relationship between bhāvas and their corresponding rasas, emphasizing their inseparable connection[14]
- **Dhanañjaya** (10th century CE) in his Daśarūpaka further systematized the classification of bhāvas in relation to dramatic forms[15]
- **Śāradātanaya** (12th century CE) in the Bhāvaprakāśana expanded the analysis of bhāvas to include additional categories and subcategories[16]

### Abhinavagupta's Synthesis (10th-11th century CE)

Abhinavagupta's commentary on the Nāṭyaśāstra, the Abhinavabhāratī, represents the most sophisticated philosophical treatment of bhāva theory[17]. He clarified the ontological status of bhāvas, explaining that they are called bhāvas because they "bring into being" (bhāvayanti) the aesthetic emotions[18]. Abhinavagupta emphasized that bhāvas are not merely psychological states but transformative forces that enable the manifestation of rasa through a process of universalization (sādhāraṇīkaraṇa)[19].

## Theoretical Framework

### Classification of Bhāvas

Bharata's Nāṭyaśāstra identifies forty-nine bhāvas in total, organized into three primary categories[5]:

#### 1. Sthāyibhāva (स्थायिभाव) - Permanent or Dominant Emotions

Sthāyibhāvas are the stable, enduring emotional states that form the foundation for the corresponding rasas[3]. These eight fundamental emotions persist throughout a dramatic work and ultimately transform into the aesthetic experience of rasa[20]:

| Sthāyibhāva | Meaning | Corresponding Rasa |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Rati (रति) | Love | Śṛṅgāra (erotic) |
| Hāsa (हास) | Mirth | Hāsya (comic) |
| Śoka (शोक) | Sorrow | Karuṇa (pathetic) |
| Krodha (क्रोध) | Anger | Raudra (furious) |
| Utsāha (उत्साह) | Energy | Vīra (heroic) |
| Bhaya (भय) | Fear | Bhayānaka (terrible) |
| Jugupsā (जुगुप्सा) | Disgust | Bībhatsa (odious) |
| Vismaya (विस्मय) | Astonishment | Adbhuta (marvelous) |

Later theorists added Śama (शम) or tranquility as the ninth sthāyibhāva, corresponding to Śānta rasa[21].

#### 2. Vyabhicāribhāva (व्यभिचारिभाव) - Transitory or Complementary Emotions

Vyabhicāribhāvas (also called sañcāribhāvas) are thirty-three transient emotional states that arise and subside during the course of a dramatic presentation[10]. These emotions complement and enhance the sthāyibhāvas, creating emotional depth and complexity[22]. Some key vyabhicāribhāvas include:

- Nirveda (निर्वेद) - Despondency
- Glāni (ग्लानि) - Weakness
- Śaṅkā (शङ्का) - Apprehension
- Īrṣyā (ईर्ष्या) - Jealousy
- Mada (मद) - Intoxication
- Unmāda (उन्माद) - Insanity
- Smṛti (स्मृति) - Recollection
- Dhṛti (धृति) - Firmness
- Harṣa (हर्ष) - Joy
- Āvega (आवेग) - Agitation[23]

These transitory emotions are not permanent like sthāyibhāvas but arise in specific contexts and situations, enriching the emotional texture of the dramatic experience[24].

#### 3. Sāttvikabhāva (सात्त्विकभाव) - Involuntary Physical Responses

Sāttvikabhāvas are eight involuntary physical manifestations that arise from intense emotional states[14]. They represent the bodily expressions of emotion that cannot be deliberately simulated but must emerge naturally from the performer's immersion in the character's psychological state[25]:

- Stambha (स्तम्भ) - Paralysis
- Sveda (स्वेद) - Perspiration
- Romāñca (रोमाञ्च) - Horripilation (goosebumps)
- Svarabheda (स्वरभेद) - Change of voice
- Vepathu (वेपथु) - Trembling
- Vaivarṇya (वैवर्ण्य) - Change of color
- Aśru (अश्रु) - Tears
- Pralaya (प्रलय) - Fainting[15]

These physical responses are considered particularly significant because they demonstrate the performer's authentic emotional engagement, bridging the gap between simulated and genuine feeling[26].

### Mechanisms of Bhāva Expression

Bharata's theory identifies three key mechanisms through which bhāvas are expressed and communicated in dramatic performance[27]:

#### 1. Vibhāva (विभाव) - Determinants or Stimuli

Vibhāvas are the causes or determinants that stimulate emotional states[28]. They are divided into two types:

- **Ālambana Vibhāva** (आलम्बन विभाव) - The primary stimulus or object of emotion (e.g., the beloved in romantic love)[1]
- **Uddīpana Vibhāva** (उद्दीपन विभाव) - The enhancing or intensifying circumstances (e.g., moonlight, fragrance, or music that intensifies romantic feelings)[25]

Vibhāvas provide the contextual foundation that makes the emotional expression intelligible and relatable to the audience[29].

#### 2. Anubhāva (अनुभाव) - Consequents or Physical Manifestations

Anubhāvas are the voluntary physical expressions that communicate emotional states through deliberate gestures, movements, and vocal modulations[30]. These include facial expressions, hand gestures (mudrās), postures, and speech patterns that externalize the internal emotional state[2]. Anubhāvas are the bridge between the performer's internal experience and the audience's perception[31].

#### 3. Vyabhicāribhāva (व्यभिचारिभाव) - Transitory Emotional States

As previously discussed, these thirty-three transient emotions complement the primary emotional state, creating a complex emotional landscape that enriches the dramatic experience[10]. They arise and subside throughout the performance, adding nuance and depth to the character's psychological portrayal[32].

### The Bhāva-Rasa Relationship

The relationship between bhāva and rasa represents one of the most sophisticated aspects of Sanskrit aesthetic theory[33]. While distinct, these concepts are inextricably linked in a process of aesthetic transformation:

1. **Causal Relationship**: Bhāvas are the causes that produce rasas as their effects[34]. The performer embodies bhāvas, which then evoke corresponding rasas in the receptive audience[35].

2. **Transformation Process**: Bharata's famous formula "vibhāvānubhāvavyabhicārisamyogād rasaniṣpattiḥ" (from the combination of determinants, consequents, and transitory states arises rasa) describes how bhāvas combine to generate rasa[5].

3. **Universalization**: Abhinavagupta introduced the concept of sādhāraṇīkaraṇa (universalization), explaining how personal emotions (bhāvas) are transformed into universal aesthetic experiences (rasas) through artistic representation[36].

4. **Ontological Distinction**: Bhāvas exist in the realm of ordinary experience (laukika), while rasas belong to the transcendent aesthetic domain (alaukika)[37]. This distinction highlights the transformative power of art to elevate ordinary emotions into extraordinary aesthetic experiences[38].

## Applications in Different Art Forms

### Nāṭya (Drama)

In classical Sanskrit drama, bhāva theory guides the actor's psychological preparation and physical expression[39]. The nāṭyadharmi (stylized) approach to performance requires actors to master the external manifestations (anubhāvas) of various emotional states while internally cultivating the corresponding psychological conditions[40]. The actor's ability to embody bhāvas convincingly is considered essential for successful dramatic communication[41].

### Nṛtya (Dance)

Classical Indian dance forms like Bharatanatyam, Kathak, and Odissi rely heavily on bhāva theory for their expressive dimensions[42]. Dancers use abhinaya (expressive technique) to portray specific bhāvas through codified facial expressions, hand gestures, and body movements[43]. The concept of sāttvikābhinaya specifically addresses the manifestation of sāttvikabhāvas, requiring dancers to achieve authentic emotional states rather than merely simulating them[44].

### Saṅgīta (Music)

In Indian classical music, rāgas are associated with specific emotional qualities (bhāvas) that musicians must understand and evoke through their performance[45]. The concept of bhāva in music relates to the emotional character or mood that a particular rāga is designed to express, guiding the musician's improvisational choices and expressive techniques[46].

### Kāvya (Poetry)

Sanskrit poetics applies bhāva theory to literary composition, analyzing how poets create emotional resonance through language[47]. The concept of bhāvābhivyañjanā (expression of emotion) in poetry involves the skillful use of imagery, metaphor, and sound to evoke specific emotional states in the reader[48]. Theorists like Mammata in his Kāvyaprakāśa explored how poetic language can effectively communicate bhāvas without the visual and auditory dimensions available in performance arts[37].

## Philosophical Dimensions

### Ontological Status of Bhāvas

Sanskrit aestheticians debated the ontological status of bhāvas, questioning whether they are subjective psychological states or objective realities with independent existence[49]. Abhinavagupta's non-dualistic approach suggests that bhāvas exist in a liminal space between subjectivity and objectivity, becoming fully realized only in the aesthetic encounter between performer and audience[50].

### Epistemological Considerations

The knowledge of bhāvas raises important epistemological questions about how we recognize and understand emotional states in others[51]. The theory suggests that bhāvas are communicated through a complex semiotic system of physical signs (anubhāvas) that allow audiences to infer the underlying emotional states[52]. This process involves both direct perception and interpretive understanding[53].

### Psychological Insights

Bhāva theory offers sophisticated psychological insights into the nature of human emotions and their expression[54]. The classification of emotions into permanent, transitory, and involuntary categories anticipates modern psychological distinctions between core affects, moods, and physiological responses[55]. The theory's emphasis on the interconnectedness of mental states and physical expressions aligns with contemporary embodied cognition approaches to emotion.

## Points of Contention and Scholarly Debates

### Relationship Between Sthāyibhāva and Rasa

Scholars have debated whether sthāyibhāva and rasa are fundamentally different or merely different aspects of the same phenomenon. Bhaṭṭa Lollaṭa (9th century CE) argued that sthāyibhāva itself becomes rasa through intensification, while Śrī Śaṅkuka maintained that rasa is merely the inference of sthāyibhāva. Abhinavagupta rejected both views, arguing that rasa emerges through a unique process of aesthetic universalization that transcends ordinary emotional experience.

### Status of Sāttvikabhāvas

The classification of sāttvikabhāvas has generated significant debate. Some theorists questioned whether these involuntary physical responses should be considered bhāvas at all or simply classified as anubhāvas (consequents). Others, like Abhinavagupta, defended their special status, arguing that sāttvikabhāvas represent a unique category of expression that bridges the gap between internal feeling and external manifestation.

### Number and Classification of Bhāvas

While Bharata's system identifies forty-nine bhāvas, later theorists proposed alternative classifications and additions. Some traditions expanded the list of vyabhicāribhāvas beyond thirty-three, while others suggested additional categories of bhāvas. These taxonomical debates reflect the ongoing effort to create a comprehensive framework for understanding the full spectrum of human emotional expression.

### Bhāva in Devotional Contexts

The application of bhāva theory to devotional (bhakti) contexts introduced new complexities. In Vaiṣṇava traditions, particularly following Rūpa Gosvāmī's 16th-century Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, bhāvas were reinterpreted as spiritual emotions directed toward the divine[16]. This adaptation raised questions about whether aesthetic and devotional bhāvas should be considered fundamentally different or variations of the same psychological phenomena.

## Historical Timeline of Development

| Modern Period (19th century onward) | Integration with performance practices and contemporary aesthetics | Rabindranath Tagore, Ananda Coomaraswamy |

## Contemporary Relevance and Applications

### Performance Practice

Contemporary practitioners of classical Indian performing arts continue to engage with bhāva theory as a framework for emotional expression. Training in these traditions involves systematic cultivation of the ability to embody and communicate various bhāvas through physical and vocal techniques. Modern performers often integrate traditional bhāva theory with contemporary psychological approaches to character development and emotional expression.

### Cross-Cultural Aesthetics

Bhāva theory has attracted interest from Western performance theorists and directors seeking alternatives to psychological realism. Concepts like Bertolt Brecht's "gestus" and Jerzy Grotowski's "via negativa" have been compared with aspects of bhāva theory, suggesting potential for cross-cultural dialogue in performance studies. The theory's sophisticated understanding of the relationship between internal states and external expression offers valuable insights for contemporary approaches to acting and dance.

### Psychological Research

Recent psychological research on emotions has found interesting parallels with bhāva theory's classifications and mechanisms. The distinction between core emotions (similar to sthāyibhāvas) and transitory emotional states (similar to vyabhicāribhāvas) aligns with contemporary models of affective science. Studies of embodied cognition and emotional expression have also validated many of the theory's insights about the relationship between psychological states and physical manifestations.

### Therapeutic Applications

Elements of bhāva theory have been incorporated into dance/movement therapy and expressive arts therapies. The systematic understanding of emotional expression provides a framework for therapeutic approaches that use movement and performance to address psychological issues. The theory's emphasis on the transformative potential of emotional expression resonates with contemporary therapeutic models that view artistic expression as a pathway to psychological integration.

## Conclusion

Bhāva theory represents one of the most sophisticated frameworks for understanding emotional expression and aesthetic experience in world intellectual history. Its comprehensive classification of emotional states, detailed analysis of their manifestation, and profound insights into their transformation through artistic representation continue to offer valuable resources for performers, scholars, and audiences. While inextricably linked with Rasa theory, Bhāva theory maintains its distinct identity as the study of the psychological infrastructure that makes aesthetic experience possible.

The enduring relevance of Bhāva theory lies in its recognition that emotions are not merely subjective internal states but dynamic processes that connect individuals through shared expressive forms. By providing a systematic vocabulary and conceptual framework for understanding the full spectrum of human emotional expression, Bhāva theory continues to illuminate the profound relationship between inner experience and outward manifestation that lies at the heart of all artistic communication.

Now, further to our discussion of Rasa and Bhava, I wish to seque into Divine lila, sport, pastimes or play. For example, Sri Krishna and a Gaudiya Vaishnava understanding of Nitya Lila. Now, in English and in the Wester mindset, theatre, plays and drama are very different beasts to their tradition form in India. Anciently and traditionally in India, dramaturgy was a performative polyglot exercise, Sanskrit was important in oerformance, but to the people, Sankrit as the only language or sile lang&age of performance in a performative event was not only precious rare, but an anomy. Though speech in the dramaturgy of India is evident, it should be clearly understood that Indian languages lend themselves fundamentally, due to their structure, to poetics, lyricism, singing and melodious evocation and this mode of speech communication was foregrounded in Indian performative dramaturgy, as was dance, instead of everyday walking. In this, we understand the arising Bollywood and comparable. It is often stated and generally understood to Vaishnavas, that the permanent Spiritual World, as different to transient Heavens, is one where every word is a song and every step is a dance. This is the Rasalila. I feel it is interesting that I have come across no attestations for circle dances in India, such as the Rasa Lila prior to the migration and influx of Sufi schools and Islam. The Koran emphasises an eternal spiritual world as different to heaven and arguablyv so does some forms of mediaeval Christianity wirh the distinctuon between The Kingdom of God and Heaven. As tge youngest principal Vaishnava sampradaya, the Six Goswamis synthesized extensively and re-interpreted that which had gone before. Christianity and Islam and Sahajiya, Pancharatra and Vaikhanasa and other Vaishnava and Dharmic traditions, may all be seen to influence the Gaudiya Vaishnava interpretation, amplification and sublimation, in relation to Bhakti Yoga, Lila, Nitya Lila, Bhava and Rasa, divine eternal relationshios and divinised emotions.

# Divine Līlā: The Synthesis of Eternal Play in Gaudiya Vaiṣṇava Tradition

## Introduction

The concept of divine līlā represents one of the most sophisticated theological developments in Indian spiritual thought, reaching its fullest expression in the Gaudiya Vaiṣṇava tradition founded by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in 16th-century Bengal[1]. This investigation explores the intricate synthesis that emerged when the Six Goswamis, Caitanya's principal disciples, encountered and absorbed diverse religious and cultural currents to create a unique understanding of eternal divine pastimes (nitya-līlā)[2]. The tradition's development reveals fascinating parallels with Islamic mysticism, medieval Christianity, and earlier Vaiṣṇava schools, while establishing revolutionary concepts about the nature of divine play and the eternal spiritual world[3].

## Etymology and Foundational Concepts

### Līlā: The Divine Play

**Līlā** (लीला)
- **Devanagari**: लीला
- **IAST**: līlā
- **Root Etymology**: From the Sanskrit root √līl meaning "to play, sport, amuse oneself"
- **Pronunciation**: [ˈliːlaː]

The term līlā encompasses divine play, sport, or pastime, but in Gaudiya Vaiṣṇava theology, it transcends mere recreational activity to denote the eternal, spontaneous activities of the Supreme Person[4]. Unlike mundane play, divine līlā is characterized by complete spontaneity (svataḥsiddha), absence of material motivation, and infinite blissfulness[5].

### Nitya-Līlā: Eternal Pastimes

**Nitya-līlā** (नित्यलीला)
- **Devanagari**: नित्यलीला
- **IAST**: nitya-līlā
- **Definition**: The eternal pastimes of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in the spiritual realm
- **Significance**: The timeless spiritual activities that occur beyond the material realm[5]

Nitya-līlā represents the eternal pastimes of the Divine Couple, Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, in their spiritual abode of Goloka Vṛndāvana[6]. These pastimes are characterized as nitya (eternal), meaning they exist beyond the constraints of time and material causation, perpetually manifesting in an eight-fold daily cycle (aṣṭakālīya-līlā)[6].

## The Performative Tradition of Ancient Indian Dramaturgy

### Multilingual Performance Practice

Ancient Indian dramatic tradition was fundamentally polyglot in nature, contrary to Western assumptions about Sanskrit's exclusive dominance[7]. Research reveals that Sanskrit drama employed a sophisticated code-switching system where different characters spoke different languages based on their social status, gender, and regional origin[8]. Noble protagonists and masters spoke Sanskrit, while female characters were assigned to speak Prakrit dialects such as Mahārāṣṭrī or Śaurasenī[7]. The royal comedian (vidūṣaka) spoke Prakrit, and characters from different regions used their native languages[7].

This multilingual approach served three primary functions: to establish character backgrounds and personalities, to create appropriate mood and tone for different scenes, and to enhance audience comprehension and appreciation[7]. The practice demonstrates that pure Sanskrit performance was exceptionally rare, making the assertion that Sanskrit was the sole language of ancient Indian performance an anomaly[9].

### The Lyrical Foundation of Indian Languages

Indian languages possess an inherent structural tendency toward poetics, lyricism, and melodious expression[10]. This characteristic fundamentally shaped Indian dramatic performance, where speech naturally gravitated toward song and movement toward dance[11]. The ancient educational system itself was based on musical and poetic transmission, with sacred texts like the Vedas, Upaniṣads, Rāmāyaṇa, and Mahābhārata composed as verses to facilitate singing and oral transmission[11].

This tradition explains the prominence of song and dance in modern Bollywood cinema, which can be traced directly to ancient Indian dramatic conventions[12][13]. Early Bollywood films drew heavily from classical forms like Bharatanatyam, Kathak, and Odissi, maintaining the ancient principle that dramatic expression should integrate music, dance, and poetic speech[12].

## The Spiritual Cosmology of Eternal Song and Dance

### The Vaiṣṇava Vision of Goloka

The Gaudiya Vaiṣṇava conception of the eternal spiritual world (Goloka Vṛndāvana) embodies the principle that "every word is a song and every step is a dance"[14]. This theological formulation suggests that the ultimate reality transcends ordinary speech and movement, existing in a perpetual state of aesthetic perfection where all communication occurs through divine music and all movement through sacred dance[15].

This vision parallels descriptions found in Islamic and Christian mystical traditions of an eternal spiritual realm distinct from temporary heavenly states[16]. The Quranic emphasis on an eternal spiritual world as different from heaven resonates with Gaudiya concepts of the permanent spiritual world versus transient celestial realms[16].

## The Question of Circular Dance: Pre-Islamic Attestations

### Ancient Indian Circular Ritual Patterns

Archaeological and textual evidence reveals that circular movement patterns existed in ancient Indian ritual practices well before Islamic influence[17][18]. Vedic yajña ceremonies included circumambulatory movement around sacred fires, with participants moving in eight directions along a circumambulatory path in the sacred enclosure[17]. The movement pattern symbolically recreated the cosmos and suggested the universe's process of involution, evolution, and devolution[17].

During Mahāvrata yajña ceremonies, Kumbhādāsīs danced around the homakuṇḍa in a circular pattern called Marjaliya, carrying honey-filled pots on their heads[18]. These sacred dances likely occurred in circles around holy trees or sacrificial sites, establishing precedents for circular ritual dance in pre-Islamic India[18].

### Vedic Women's Circle Dances

Textual evidence describes Vedic women performing circle dances similar to Garba or Maypole dances[18]. These ceremonial dances required at least three participants, sometimes involving six or eight people[18]. Participants carried kumbhās (pots) on their heads, tapped their right thighs with their right hands, held kumbhās in their left hands, and chanted specific mantras[18].

The ancient practice of pradakṣiṇā (clockwise circumambulation) around sacred objects, deities, or temples represents another form of circular ritual movement deeply embedded in pre-Islamic Indian tradition[19]. This practice involves walking clockwise around sacred spaces, symbolizing the eternal nature of existence with the divine as the focal point[19].

## Sufi Influence and Circular Dance Development

### The Mevlevi Tradition

Sufi whirling (samā) emerged in the 13th century through the followers of Jalāl ad-Dīn Rūmī, establishing a form of physically active meditation involving repetitive circular movement[20]. The practice aims to achieve spiritual connection with Allah through abandoning the nafs (ego) and spinning the body in repetitive circles, symbolically imitating planets orbiting the sun[20].

The whirling dance represents the soul's ascent through intellect toward the perfection of divine love[21]. As practitioners enter an ecstatic state, they transcend the ego, experiencing a spiritual return from their journey while internally transformed[21]. This practice spread to various Sufi orders, including the Chishtiyya order in India[21].

### Islamic Mystical Practices

Sufi dhikr ceremonies involve communal remembrance of God through rhythmic chanting and circular movement[22]. The Qādirī tradition practices ḥaḍra (presence), combining dhikr chanting with stamping and spiraling movements to achieve divine presence[22]. These practices emphasize the circular nature of spiritual ascension and divine remembrance[23].

## The Six Goswamis: Synthesis and Innovation

### Historical Context and Mission

The Six Goswamis—Śrī Rūpa, Śrī Sanātana, Śrī Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Śrī Jīva, Śrī Gopāla Bhaṭṭa, and Śrī Raghunātha dāsa—were principal disciples of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu who established themselves in Vṛndāvana during the 16th century[24]. Caitanya instructed them to uncover Kṛṣṇa's pastime places, install deities of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, compile scriptures on bhakti science, and propagate devotional life rules[24].

When they arrived in Vṛndāvana, it was simply an overgrown forest with no houses or villages[24]. Through their efforts, they located all of Kṛṣṇa's pastime places and commissioned the construction of temples and ghāṭs (bathing ponds)[24]. As erudite scholars, they composed essential Vaiṣṇava texts on bhakti science and established proper standards for devotional behavior[24].

### Theological Synthesis

The Goswamis' theological work represented extensive synthesis and reinterpretation of preceding traditions[2]. They integrated elements from various sources including Christianity, Islam, Sahajiyā Buddhism, Pañcarātra, and Vaikhanāsa traditions[25][26][27]. This synthesis was particularly evident in their development of rasa theory as applied to devotional theology[2].

Rūpa Goswāmī's Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu established the systematic framework for understanding devotional emotions (bhakti-rasa), adapting classical rasa theory to devotional contexts[2]. This work laid out the progression through nāma, mantra, bhāva, prema, and rasa, creating a comprehensive map of spiritual development[25].

## Religious and Cultural Syncretism in Medieval Bengal

### Islamic-Hindu Interaction

Medieval Bengal experienced extensive religious and cultural syncretism between Hindu and Muslim communities for over five hundred years (c. 1204-1757)[28]. This syncretism manifested through Sufism, Pīrism, Nāthism, Vaiṣṇavism, and the Kartābhajā sect[28]. The interaction developed common cultural expressions that bridged religious boundaries[28].

The growth of the Satya Pīr (True Saint) and Satya Nārāyaṇa (True God) cults among Muslims and Hindus respectively demonstrated this religious synthesis[28]. Poets from both communities composed lyrics expressing unity, with one Muslim poet writing: "The Hindus and the Muslims are rope of a same bundle; someone says Allah Rasul, someone says Hari. Bismillah and Sri Bishnu are the same; when they are made different, they are called Ram and Rahim"[28].

### The Sahajiyā Connection

The Vaiṣṇava Sahajiyā movement emerged from the synthesis of Buddhist Sahajayāna practices with Vaiṣṇava devotional themes[25]. This movement incorporated the Buddhist Sahajayāna's essential elements while redirecting the cause to Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the effect to Śrī Rādhārāṇī[25].

Jayadeva's Gītagovinda played a foundational role in this synthesis, with its compositional structure mirroring the Sahajiyā path's five stages (pañca āśraya): nāma, mantra, bhāva, prema, and rasa[25]. The text begins with nāma and mantra in the Daśāvatāra stotra, expresses bhāva in the third song, develops prema in subsequent songs, and culminates in the rasa of divine union[25].

## Traditional Vaiṣṇava Foundations

### Pañcarātra and Vaikhanāsa Traditions

The Pañcarātra tradition, dating to the pre-Christian era, emphasized deity worship, temple rituals, and philosophical teachings derived from the Pañcarātra Āgamas[26]. This tradition provided guidelines for deity worship, temple construction, rituals, and spiritual disciplines within Vaiṣṇavism[26]. Central to Pañcarātra practice was arcana (deity worship), establishing personal relationships with the divine through rituals, offerings, prayers, and meditation[26].

The Vaikhanāsa tradition represented another ancient Vaiṣṇava school, originating as forest-dwelling ascetics who later became temple priests[29][30]. This tradition followed the Vaikhanāsa Kalpasūtra and emphasized the five aspects of Viṣṇu: Viṣṇu (all-pervading supreme deity), Puruṣa (principle of life), Satya (static aspect), Acyuta (immutable aspect), and Aniruddha (irreducible aspect)[31].

Both traditions provided theological and ritual foundations that the Goswamis would later synthesize into their distinctive Gaudiya framework[3][32].

## Christian and Islamic Theological Parallels

### The Eternal Kingdom Concept

Medieval Christian theology distinguished between temporary heavenly states and the eternal Kingdom of God[33]. The eternal Kingdom represents a timeless realm promised to believers, signifying ultimate fulfillment and divine presence[33]. This concept parallels the Gaudiya distinction between temporary celestial realms and the permanent spiritual world of Goloka[15].

The Quranic emphasis on an eternal, living reality distinct from material existence also resonates with Gaudiya cosmology[16]. The Quran presents itself as the word of the Ever-Living God, guiding humanity toward eternal spiritual reality beyond material constraints[16].

### Mystical Union and Divine Love

Islamic Sufi traditions developed sophisticated understandings of divine love and mystical union that parallel Gaudiya conceptions of prema and rasa[21][23]. The Sufi concept of fanā (annihilation of the ego) corresponds to the Gaudiya understanding of surrendering individual desire for divine pleasure[34].

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's own interactions with Muslim scholars demonstrate this theological resonance[34]. When a Muslim saint attempted to establish impersonal Brahman based on Quranic authority, Caitanya demonstrated that the Quran ultimately establishes a personal God with a blackish complexion, full of opulence[34].

## The Rāsa-līlā: Culmination of Divine Play

### Theological Significance

The Rāsa-līlā represents the culmination of divine play in Gaudiya theology, described as the ultimate expression of spiritual love between the divine and individual souls[4]. This circular dance, where Kṛṣṇa multiplies himself to dance simultaneously with each gopī, symbolizes the perfect fulfillment of individual spiritual longing[4].

The Bhāgavata Purāṇa states that whoever faithfully hears or describes the rāsa-līlā attains Kṛṣṇa's pure loving devotion (śuddha-bhakti)[4]. The narrative describes how Kṛṣṇa supernaturally extends one night to the length of one kalpa (approximately 4.32 billion years), allowing the eternal dance to unfold beyond temporal constraints[4].

### Symbolic and Spiritual Dimensions

In Gaudiya interpretation, the Rāsa-līlā transcends literal historical narrative to represent the eternal relationship between the Supreme Person and individual souls[4]. The circular formation symbolizes the perfect equality of love, where each soul experiences complete divine attention without competition or hierarchy[35].

This understanding transforms the circle dance from a temporal event into an eternal spiritual reality, accessible through pure devotional consciousness rather than material proximity[6]. The concept of nitya-līlā suggests that these pastimes exist perpetually in the spiritual dimension, with devotees potentially entering this eternal dance directly or in service in the divine realm through advanced spiritual practice and grace[5].

## Contemporary Implications and Legacy

### Modern Expressions

The influence of this synthetic tradition extends into contemporary cultural expressions, particularly through the global spread of Gaudiya Vaiṣṇava teachings via ISKCON and the Hare Krishna movement[36]. These organizations have carried the understanding of divine līlā and eternal spiritual relationships throughout the world, adapting ancient theological concepts to modern contexts[36].

The continued relevance of circular dance and divine play concepts appears in various contemporary spiritual movements that emphasize embodied spirituality and the integration of artistic expression with religious practice[37]. The understanding that authentic spiritual experience transcends ordinary consciousness while remaining accessible through devotional practice continues to attract practitioners across cultural boundaries[15].

## Conclusion

The development of divine līlā concepts within Gaudiya Vaiṣṇavism represents one of history's most sophisticated examples of religious synthesis and theological innovation. The Six Goswamis' integration of diverse traditions—from ancient Vedic circular rituals to Islamic mystical practices, from Christian concepts of eternal kingdoms to Buddhist understandings of transcendent consciousness and various agamic and tantric threads — created a unique theological framework that maintains relevance across cultural and temporal boundaries.

The question of circular dance attestations in pre-Islamic India reveals a complex picture of indigenous practices that provided foundations for later developments, whilst acknowledging the significant influence of Islamic mystical traditions in refining and emphasizing these patterns. The Gaudiya synthesis demonstrates how authentic spiritual traditions can incorporate diverse influences whilst maintaining doctrinal integrity and practical effectiveness.

The vision of an eternal spiritual world where "every word is a song and every step is a dance" represents more than poetic metaphor - it articulates a comprehensive understanding of reality where aesthetic experience, divine relationship and ultimate truth converge in perpetual celebration. This understanding continues to influence contemporary spirituality, performance traditions, and theological discourse, demonstrating the enduring power of the Goswamis' synthetic achievement.
