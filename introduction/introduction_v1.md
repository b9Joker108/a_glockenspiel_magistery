Let’s start with “bright”:

Etymology:"Bright" comes from the Old English beorht (also found as bryht in metathesized forms), meaning “radiating or reflecting light” as well as “splendid” or “beautiful.” This Old English word is inherited from the Proto-Germanic *berhtaz, which in turn derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *bhereg- meaning “to shine; bright, white.” Over time, the word not only came to describe physical light but also was used metaphorically for mental quickness or brilliance (the figurative sense of “quick-witted” appears much later, around the mid-18th century).

First Attestation:The adjective appears in Old English texts — the form “beorht” (or its metathesized variant “bryht”) is attested in early medieval literature. Although exact dates in the Old English period are not always specified in modern etymological entries, “bright” in its original sense is well attested in Old English sources from the early medieval period .

Now for “murk”:

Etymology:"Murk" comes from Middle English mirke (or alternatively spelled “mirk”), itself derived from Old Norse myrkr, meaning “darkness” or “gloom.” This word ultimately comes from Proto-Germanic *merkwjo- (or similar forms), and is linked through related words in several Germanic languages. The Proto-Indo-European root *mergʰ- is posited to mean “to flicker; to darken; to be dark” .

First Attestation:The noun “murk,” meaning “gloom” or “darkness,” is first attested around c. 1300. In Middle English it was used both as a noun and, later, as an adjective. The word often appeared in literary and descriptive contexts to evoke the sense of a dark, gloomy environment. The term “mirk” remains common as a variant, especially in Scottish usage, and in poetic language “murkiness” continues to be a recognized term for deep darkness .

These origins not only reveal the linguistic roots of common descriptors but also show how words evolve to encompass broader metaphorical meanings with cultural usage over time.

If you’re interested in exploring how these words transition across periods—or how their cognates appear in other languages—I can share more on related terms and historical usage examples.
