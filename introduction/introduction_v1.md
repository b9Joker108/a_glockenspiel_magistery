Ram Yam Kham Aum Ah Hung Phat Svaha Ah Emaho!

Long ago, in my mid-twenties, when I was reading works on Jungian 'Shadow Work' and actually doing the Work, I came across a well-written, astute and evocative writer, who used 'bright side' and 'murk side', throughout their work. It vexes me as I do not remember the author(s) or the work, but it profoundly moved me and has stayed with ne all these years. I have written of it in other works. Both of the terms 'bright' and 'murk' are Germanic in origin and have deeper roots. I didn't know that then, but I know it now. For me, this holds import. I use the terms and concepts bright-stave and murk-stave in my runework. Which, to my knowledge, has roots in the work of Thorsson (1999, 1988), a *nom-de-plume* for Flowers, who likely came by these terms in mediaeval or pre-modern Icelandic, Swedish, Germanic runelore or other writings, grimoire or folk-traditions.


Let’s start with “bright”:

Etymology:"Bright" comes from the Old English beorht (also found as bryht in metathesized forms), meaning “radiating or reflecting light” as well as “splendid” or “beautiful.” This Old English word is inherited from the Proto-Germanic *berhtaz, which in turn derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *bhereg- meaning “to shine; bright, white.” Over time, the word not only came to describe physical light but also was used metaphorically for mental quickness or brilliance (the figurative sense of “quick-witted” appears much later, around the mid-18th century).

First Attestation:The adjective appears in Old English texts — the form “beorht” (or its metathesized variant “bryht”) is attested in early medieval literature. Although exact dates in the Old English period are not always specified in modern etymological entries, “bright” in its original sense is well attested in Old English sources from the early medieval period .

Now for “murk”:

Etymology:"Murk" comes from Middle English mirke (or alternatively spelled “mirk”), itself derived from Old Norse myrkr, meaning “darkness” or “gloom.” This word ultimately comes from Proto-Germanic *merkwjo- (or similar forms), and is linked through related words in several Germanic languages. The Proto-Indo-European root *mergʰ- is posited to mean “to flicker; to darken; to be dark” .

First Attestation:The noun “murk,” meaning “gloom” or “darkness,” is first attested around c. 1300. In Middle English it was used both as a noun and, later, as an adjective. The word often appeared in literary and descriptive contexts to evoke the sense of a dark, gloomy environment. The term “mirk” remains common as a variant, especially in Scottish usage, and in poetic language “murkiness” continues to be a recognized term for deep darkness .

These origins not only reveal the linguistic roots of common descriptors but also show how words evolve to encompass broader metaphorical meanings with cultural usage over time.
