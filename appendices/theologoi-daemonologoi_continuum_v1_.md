I understand that in the times of Ancient Greece, Ancient Greek and Ancient Greece was the locus of cultural refinement, whilst Ancient Rome and Ancient Latin were the political and administrative locus. At this time, Theologoi and Daemonologoi were synonymous and were too in the early periods of Classicism. It was only during the Scottish witchtrials and the publications and reign of King James that they became bifurcated into Theologie and Daemonologie and this duplicity was the construction and artifice of King James and it has been perpetuated subquently.

Your observation about the historical evolution of "theology" and "demonology" is insightful, though the timeline requires slight refinement. Here's a nuanced breakdown:

### 1. **Ancient Greek/Latin Unity (Theologoi/Daemonologoi)**
   - **Synonymity**: In Classical antiquity, "theologoi" (θεολόγοι) referred to poets/mythographers (e.g., Hesiod, Orpheus) who explained divine origins. "Daimon" (δαίμων) denoted lesser divine beings or guiding spirits (e.g., Socrates' daimonion).  
   - **Philosophical Blurring**: Plato and Neoplatonists (like Plotinus) used "daimones" as intermediaries between gods and humans, maintaining conceptual proximity to theology.

### 2. **Early Christian Shift (Not James I)**
   - **Patristic Separation**: By the 2nd–4th centuries CE, Church Fathers like Tertullian and Augustine began redefining "daimones" as *demonic* (evil spirits). This was:  
     - A theological strategy to pagan deities.  
     - Reinforced by texts like the *Testament of Solomon* (3rd c. CE).  
   - **Scholastic Codification**: Thomas Aquinas (13th c.) systematized demonology within theology in *Summa Theologica*, distinguishing angels (divine) from demons (fallen).

### 3. **King James' Role: Amplifier, Not Originator**
   - **Daemonologie (1597)**: James VI of Scotland (later James I of England) wrote this text to:  
     - Legitimize witch-hunting (e.g., North Berwick trials).  
     - Assert royal authority over spiritual threats.  
   - **Political Tool**: The treatise *popularized* the bifurcation but didn't invent it. It reflected existing Continental ideas (e.g., Heinrich Kramer's *Malleus Maleficarum*, 1487).  
   - **Witch Trials**: Scottish trials (1590s) and later English ones (e.g., Pendle, 1612) became vehicles for enforcing this duality, but Catholic Inquisitions had done so earlier.

### 4. **Linguistic Evidence**
   - **Greek Roots**:  
     - θεολόγος (*theologos*): "God" + "discourse"  
     - δαιμονολόγος (*daimonologos*): "Spirit" + "discourse"  
   - **Semantic Drift**: "Daimon" shifted from neutral (Socrates) to negative (Christianity), while "theology" became the study of *true* divinity.

### 5. **Why the Confusion?**
   James I's influence is overstated because:  
   - His book framed witchcraft as heresy (linking it to theology).  
   - His patronage of the *King James Bible* (1611) cemented his association with religious authority.  
   - Post-Reformation England amplified his role, obscuring earlier Catholic precedents.

### Key Takeaway:
The bifurcation began with **early Christian apologetics** (2nd–5th c. CE), was **codified by Scholasticism** (13th c.), and was **weaponized by James** (1597) for political control. James didn't create the split but exploited existing frameworks to consolidate power during religious turmoil.

For linguistic depth: The Greek *daimon* and Sanskrit *deva* ("shining one") share Proto-Indo-European roots (*deiwos*), yet their connotations diverged dramatically—Christianity demonized what Vedic culture revered. This mirrors your interest in comparative semantics! Would you like to explore this Indo-European angle further?
