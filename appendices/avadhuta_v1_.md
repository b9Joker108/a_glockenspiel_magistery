**In summary:**  
*Avadhūta* is a pan-Indic spiritual and philosophical term, with a rich web of **polysemy** and **semantic extension**. It is a **Lehnwort** in most Indo-Aryan languages, with regional **phonological adaptation** and **semantic bleaching**. In Tibetan, it is represented by a **calque** (nyönpa), showing conceptual rather than phonological transfer. Across all these languages, the term’s core metaphor—“shaken off”—is preserved and extended through **predicate transfer** and **metaphoric extension**, producing a constellation of meanings: renunciate, mad saint, antinomian, and spiritual exemplar[1][2][3][4][5][7][8].

Avadhuta and ava- and -dhuta have many denotations you have not mentioned. Sanskrit is profoundly rich in polysemy.

Absolutely correct—Sanskrit’s polysemy is vast, and both the prefix **ava-** and the root **dhū** (and its participle **dhūta**) have a rich spectrum of meanings, which, when compounded as **avadhūta**, generate a web of denotations far beyond the spiritual or ascetic. Here is a more exhaustive academic treatment, with all relevant technical terminology and attested denotations.

## 4. **Technical Table of Polysemy and Semantic Processes**

| Denotation/Usage    | Script/IAST         | Semantic Process(es)         | Attestation/Context        |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Shaken off, removed | अवधूत / avadhūta    | Literal, spatial metaphor    | Lexicons, grammars         |
| Purified, cleansed  | अवधूत / avadhūta    | Ritual metaphor, predicate transfer | Ritual texts, Upanishads   |

## 5. **Summary of Technical Processes at Work**

- **Regular polysemy**: Multiple, related senses coexisting in the lexicon
- **Metaphoric extension**: Physical “shaking off” → spiritual/social/psychological liberation
- **Metonymic extension**: Name of a state → name of a person or text
- **Synecdoche**: “Shaken off” (part) for “outcast/renunciate” (whole)
- **Predicate transfer**: Attributes of “removal” or “cleansing” mapped onto people, actions, or states
- **Semantic broadening**: From literal to ritual, social, and spiritual meanings
- **Semantic bleaching**: In some contexts, loss of radical meaning, becoming just “ascetic” or “renunciate”
- **Pejoration**: In folk usage, “madman” or “eccentric”

---

**In summary:**  
The Sanskrit **avadhūta** and its components **ava-** and **dhūta** are exemplary of the language’s profound polysemy and semantic creativity. Their denotations span the literal, ritual, social, psychological, spiritual, technical, and even pejorative, all connected through a web of metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and predicate transfer, and richly attested across the Sanskrit textual tradition.


You did very well, but you forgot: dejected, neglected, cleanv as well as dirty. What is the technical name for a term that has diametrically opposite denotations?

Thank you for your close reading and for highlighting those additional senses. You are absolutely correct: **avadhūta** and its components also encompass meanings such as "dejected," "neglected," "clean," and, paradoxically, "dirty" or "soiled." This is a hallmark of Sanskrit’s capacity for profound **polysemy** and semantic complexity.

## Technical Term for a Word with Opposite Denotations

The precise linguistic term for a single word that encompasses **diametrically opposite meanings** is:

### **Enantiosemy** (also called **enantionymy** or **auto-antonymy**)

- **Definition:**  
  Enantiosemy is the phenomenon where a single word (or lexeme) develops two opposite or contradictory meanings.
- **Other English terms:**  
  - **Contronym** (sometimes spelled "contranym")
  - **Janus word** (in popular usage)
  - **Antagonym** (less common)
- **Technical Usage:**  
  - In academic linguistics, **enantiosemy** is the standard term.

---

## Examples of Enantiosemy in Sanskrit and English

- **Sanskrit:**  
  - *Avadhūta* can mean both "purified, clean" and "soiled, dirty"; "respected ascetic" and "neglected outcast"; "dejected" and "exalted."
- **English:**  
  - "Cleave" (to split apart / to cling together)
  - "Sanction" (to permit / to penalize)

## Summary Table

| Phenomenon         | Technical Term(s)     | Description                                   | Example (Sanskrit/English)         |
|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Opposite meanings  | Enantiosemy, enantionymy, auto-antonymy, contronym, Janus word | One word with diametrically opposed senses    | avadhūta ("clean"/"dirty"), "cleave" |

---

**In summary:**  
The technical term for a word like **avadhūta** that carries opposing denotations is **enantiosemy**. This phenomenon is well-attested in Sanskrit and many other languages, and is a testament to the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of lexical meaning.



Now, define avadhuta in a way that holds true for all this complexityv as well as specificity and different attestions and gradations of usage and attribution, for its postitive connotations and negative denotations.

Here is a definition of **avadhūta** that fully encompasses its profound polysemy, specificity, gradations, and both positive and negative denotations, as attested in classical, ritual, philosophical, social, and colloquial contexts:

---

## Avadhūta (अवधूत, IAST: avadhūta)

**Avadhūta** is a Sanskrit term (from *ava-* “off, away, down” + *dhūta* “shaken, cleansed, removed, agitated”) exhibiting **enantiosemy**—it holds diametrically opposed meanings and a spectrum of nuanced, context-dependent senses[2][5].

### **Positive Denotations and Connotations**
- **Spiritually liberated being:** One who has “shaken off” all worldly ties, social conventions, dualities, and egoic consciousness, attaining the state of a *jīvanmukta* or living liberated soul[1][3][4][5][6].
- **Pure, cleansed, or purified:** One who is ritually or spiritually purified, having removed karmic or mental impurities[2][5].
- **Exalted sage or mystic:** A teacher or guru who, having transcended social and ritual obligations, embodies pure consciousness and may serve as a spiritual guide[1][3][5].
- **Immortal, indestructible:** Sometimes glossed as “immortal” (*akṣara*) in Upanishadic and Vedantic sources, signifying transcendence of death and limitation[1][6].
- **Beyond law and convention:** One who acts spontaneously, freely, and is not bound by religious or social norms, sometimes described as “divine madman” or “holy fool”[3][4][7].

### **Negative and Ambivalent Denotations**
- **Neglected, rejected, or dejected:** One who is cast out, disregarded, or socially excluded, sometimes seen as an outcaste or marginalized figure[2][5].
- **Dirty, soiled, or unclean:** That which is or has become soiled, or upon which something unclean has been shaken off; also, one who is unconcerned with external purity[2][5].
- **Madman, lunatic, or deranged:** In some contexts, a person perceived as insane, agitated, or possessed, due to their disregard for norms or eccentric behavior[2][3][5][8].
- **Agitated, disturbed, or defeated:** Describing one who is unsettled, shaken, or even defeated or absorbed (in some poetic or philosophical usages)[2][8].

### **Other Denotations and Technical Usages**
- **Fanned, kindled, agitated:** Used for plants or dust stirred by wind, or for ritual actions (e.g., fanned flames)[2][5].
- **Touched, moved:** Describes something physically touched or affected[2].
- **Head movement in drama:** A specific gesture in classical Indian dance and drama (Nāṭyaśāstra)[2][5].
- **Scriptural and sectarian titles:** Appears in the titles of Upanishads (*Avadhūta Upaniṣad*, *Turīyatītāvadhūta Upaniṣad*), scriptures (*Avadhūta Gītā*), and as a name for saints, deities (e.g., Dattātreya, Śiva), and lineages[2][3][6].
- **Jain and Buddhist usage:** In Jainism, denotes an ascetic who has renounced all ties, sometimes a Digambara monk; in Buddhism, a “mad saint” (Tibetan: *nyönpa*)[3][5].

### **Summary Table of Polysemy**

| Domain         | Positive/Neutral Denotation           | Negative/Ambivalent Denotation         |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Spiritual      | Liberated sage, pure, immortal, guru | Madman, deranged, possessed            |
| Social         | Renunciate, outcast by choice        | Neglected, rejected, dejected, excluded|
| Physical/Ritual| Cleansed, purified, fanned, kindled  | Dirty, soiled, agitated, disturbed     |
| Technical      | Head movement (drama)                | Absorbed, defeated (poetic)            |

---

**In summary:**  
**Avadhūta** is an enantiosemic Sanskrit term encompassing a spectrum from the most exalted, liberated sage—pure, immortal, and free—to the most marginalized or rejected—dirty, mad, or dejected. It is used for those who have “shaken off” all attachments, whether in spiritual triumph or social neglect, and its meaning shifts fluidly across ritual, philosophical, social, and literary contexts, reflecting the profound polysemy and semantic richness of Sanskrit[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].
