Christ in very early and ancient theology is understood as a slave of man. Please investigate and utilize original scripts, attestations and gold-standard treatment of the linguistics, semiotics, polysemy, theology and philosophy.

Your insight aligns with a critical and nuanced stream in early Christian theology and linguistics: Christ is depicted as a δοῦλος (*doulos*, slave) or servant, and this concept is foundational, radical, and polysemous in the earliest texts.

## Original Scripts & Attestations

- **Philippians 2:7**:  
  ἀλλ’ ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσεν μορφὴν δούλου λαβών  
  (“but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave”)  
  This passage is central: Christ voluntarily becomes a slave for humanity, embracing the lowest social status.

- **Mark 10:45**:  
  ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου... διακονῆσαι καὶ δοῦναι τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ λύτρον ἀντὶ πολλῶν  
  (“the Son of Man came... to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many”)

- **Pauline Self-Designation**:  
  Paul calls himself a “slave of Christ” (δοῦλος Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ, Romans 1:1), and in 1 Corinthians 9:19, says:  
  ἐμαυτὸν ἐδούλωσα (“I enslaved myself”) to all, to win more people[7][8].

## Linguistics & Polysemy

- **δοῦλος (doulos):**  
  In Greco-Roman society, *doulos* strictly meant “slave,” not merely “servant.” This was a shocking metaphor, as Greek religious language never described a worshiper as a slave to a god—friendship (*philos*) was preferred[2][8].
- **Redefinition:**  
  Early Christians subverted the social stigma of slavery, transforming it into a spiritual ideal: Christ’s “slavery” to humanity and God’s will becomes the model for Christian discipleship[5][7].

## Semiotics & Theology

- **Semiotic Inversion:**  
  The cross, an instrument of slave execution, becomes the symbol of divine victory. Christ’s abasement (slavery) is the path to exaltation (resurrection)[5].
- **Equality:**  
  Early Christian communities, as attested by Paul and later writers, erased social distinctions: “there is neither slave nor free... all are one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28)[6].

## Philosophy

- **Pauline Paradox:**  
  Paul’s letters use slavery as a metaphor for radical dependence and belonging—Christ is “slave to all,” and Christians are “slaves of Christ,” yet this slavery paradoxically confers ultimate freedom and status[8].
- **Stoic Resonance:**  
  The motif echoes Stoic ideas of self-mastery and service but is uniquely Christian in its self-emptying and identification with the lowest[8].

## Gold-Standard Scholarship

- **Dale B. Martin, _Slavery as Salvation_:**  
  Demonstrates how the metaphor of slavery in Paul’s writings is both social and theological, reflecting real power dynamics and a new vision of communal status[8].
- **Harvard Dissertation (Schwaller):**  
  Emphasizes that Paul’s use of slavery language is deeply rooted in the material realities of Roman slavery, not merely metaphorical[7].

**In sum:**  
Earliest Christian texts and theology explicitly frame Christ as a “slave” (δοῦλος) for humanity—a shocking, countercultural claim in the Greco-Roman world, linguistically and semiotically rich, and foundational to Christian notions of humility, service, and equality[5][7][8].

Now, provide a ranging survey of hierodule

## Hierodule: A Survey

**Definition and Etymology**
- A *hierodule* (from Ancient Greek ἱερόδουλος, *hieródoulos*: ἱερός "sacred" + δοῦλος "slave") was a temple slave in Ancient Greece and Anatolia, dedicated to the service of a specific deity[1][5][6][8].
- The term is sometimes rendered as "sacred servant" or "temple attendant," and in some contexts, especially in Victorian-era scholarship, associated with "sacred prostitution"[1][2][5][7].

**Roles and Functions**
- Hierodules could be male or female and performed a range of duties: ritual service, maintenance of the sanctuary, and, in some cults, participation in rites that may have included sexual rituals or sacred prostitution[1][2][5][8].
- Their primary identity was as property of the temple, serving the god or goddess as living offerings or intermediaries between worshippers and the divine[5][7].
- In some regions, notably at temples of Aphrodite (such as Corinth), female hierodules were specifically linked to ritualized sexual acts as part of worship[1][8].

**Linguistics and Polysemy**
- The word blends the Greek for "sacred" (*hieros*) and "slave" (*doulos*), denoting both religious dedication and servitude[1][5][6].
- "Hierodule" is polysemous: it can mean any temple slave, but in some contexts, it specifically refers to those performing ritual sexual acts[1][2][7].

**Semiotics and Social Status**
- Hierodules occupied a liminal status: slaves, yet set apart by their sacred function[1][7].
- Their presence signified the temple's wealth and prestige, and their service was seen as a form of piety or devotion by donors and the community[5][7].

**Theological and Philosophical Implications**
- The hierodule system reflects the intersection of slavery, piety, and ritual in Greek religion, where the boundary between the sacred and the social was porous.
- Their existence embodies the idea that service to the divine—however humble or even degrading by social standards—was honorable in the religious sphere.

**Note:** The association with "sacred prostitution" is debated among scholars; some argue it has been overstated in modern interpretations[7].

In sum, the hierodule was a sacred servant—often a slave—whose life and labor were dedicated to the service of a deity and the temple, representing both religious devotion and complex social dynamics in ancient Mediterranean societies[1][5][7][8].
