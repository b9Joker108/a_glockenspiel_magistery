The flat devanagari symbols are not rendered. Is there a really good .ttf or .otf font that has them, that also has all the IAST diacritics and English Latin letters?

# Best Fonts for Devanagari Komal (Flat) Symbols, IAST Diacritics, and Latin

## Overview

To display **Devanagari music notation** (including komal/flat swara marks), **IAST diacritics**, and **Latin letters** in a single font, you need a Unicode-compliant font with comprehensive support for Devanagari, Latin (with diacritics), and music notation marks. Not all Devanagari fonts support the special marks used in Indian music notation, but some modern fonts do, and a few are specifically designed for Sanskrit and transliteration needs.

## Technical Notes

- **Komal (Flat) Swara Marks:**  
  - In Unicode, komal is usually represented by an underscore or a special combining mark below the swara letter. Not all fonts render these correctly, so test your font with sample notation before committing[5].
- **IAST Diacritics:**  
  - Most modern Unicode fonts with Latin Extended support will render IAST diacritics, but only a few combine this with full Devanagari support[6][7].
- **Music Notation Symbols:**  
  - Some Bhatkhande and Paluskar notation marks are not yet in Unicode and may require custom fonts or workarounds[8].

## Recommendations

- For **music notation, IAST, and Latin in one font**, **Adishila** is the most comprehensive free option[1].
- For professional publishing, **Skolar Devanagari** is excellent but requires a license[2].
- For general use, **Noto Sans/Serif Devanagari** and **Sanskrit 2003** are reliable, but test for your specific notation needs[4][3].

**Tip:** Always test your specific notation (including komal marks) in your chosen font before finalizing your document, as rendering can vary between software and platforms[5][1].
