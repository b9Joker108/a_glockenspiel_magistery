*   **4.1. Alaap: The Invocation**
    *   4.1.1. Jnana: The philosophy of Alaap as a meditative, non-rhythmic exploration of the raga's soul.
    *   4.1.2. Sadhana: Structured Alaap practice. A 5-minute, unmetered improvisation focusing only on the lower tetrachord (S-R-G-m), then the upper, then bridging them. Storytelling prompt: "The raga is waking up. Describe its dawn."
*   **4.2. Jod and Jhala: Giving Rhythm to the Form**
    *   4.2.1. Jnana: Jod as pulsed Alaap; Jhala as the virtuosic climax using drone strings (simulated on glockenspiel).
    *   4.2.2. Sadhana: Simulating Jhala by alternating a melodic note with a rapid striking of the tonic (Sa) or dominant (Pa). This creates a shimmering, rhythmic texture unique to the instrument.
*   **4.3. Chalan and Pakad: The Signature Gait of the Raga**
    *   4.3.1. Linguistics: Viewing the Chalan (characteristic phrases) as the "grammar and syntax" of the raga.
    *   4.3.2. Sadhana: Memorizing and internalizing the Chalan for each learned raga. Practice improvising short melodies that strictly adhere to the Chalan.
