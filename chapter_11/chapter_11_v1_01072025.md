#### **Chapter 11: Jugalbandi: The Divine Duet**
*   **11.1. The Art of Listening and Responding**
    *   11.1.1. Jnana: The roles of lead and accompaniment. The *sawaal-jawaab* (question-answer) paradigm.
    *   11.1.2. Sadhana: Practicing with a recording of another instrumentalist. Try to "answer" their phrases. This develops responsive musicality. The ultimate Jugalbandi is with the Divine, responding to the "music" of inspiration.
