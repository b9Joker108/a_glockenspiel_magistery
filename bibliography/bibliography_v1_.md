Authorship Unattributed (n.d.). 'Glockenspiel: Level One'. NB: No publication details, but as it makes reference to "cadets", it is produced by a martial company, marching band or comparable. A most useful and valuable resource for our purposes in designing a curriculum for a Western musical paradigm acquisition for glockenspiel. The document was initially sourced from - Source: https://www.amphion.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Glockenspiel-Level1.pdf (accessed: Saturday, June 14, 2025) in the following domain: Source: https://www.amphion.ca/ This website is home to the 136th Company(?) of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps (RCSCC), AMPHION, Nanaimo, British Colombia, Canada. But, there is no surety yet to assign this as an attribution.

San Diego, California, U.S.A.: Kjos Music Press. KJOS: Neil A. KJOS Music Company, Distributor. ISBN 0849773024. NB: The RCSCC with their No. "108" for 'Scarborough Fair' led me to this volume which is pure platinum, bejewelled and sublime filigree for our purposes. It constitutes a sound refresher for my lapsed pianoforte skillset. Mrs Hutchins would lament. But, the volume for the most part, is directly transferable, applicable and easily reworkable and adaptable to the glockenspiel. It is effectively, exactly what I was looking for, but was unsure how to find. Most of the published works on the glockenspiel arw 'Mickey Mouse' and juvenelia, compared to the musicality and pedagogy of this work. It is a work of its time and dated. That said, at a glance, I have determined without reservation, that it is a premium and accomplished work and will be a foundation for my Western musicality point-of-[re]entry.
