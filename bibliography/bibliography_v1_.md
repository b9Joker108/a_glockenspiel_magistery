San Diego, California, U.S.A.: Kjos Music Press. KJOS: Neil A. KJOS Music Company, Distributor. ISBN 0849773024. NB: The RCSCC with their No. "108" for 'Scarborough Fair' led me to this volume which is pure platinum, bejewelled and sublime filigree for our purposes. It constitutes a sound refresher for my lapsed pianoforte skillset. Mrs Hutchins would lament. But, the volume for the most part, is directly transferable, applicable and easily reworkable and adaptable to the glockenspiel. It is effectively, exactly what I was looking for, but was unsure how to find. Most of the published works on the glockenspiel are 'Mickey Mouse' and juvenilia, compared to the musicality and pedagogy that produced and is invested in this work. It should be noted, that it is of its time and dated. That said, at a glance, I have determined without reservation, that it is a premium and accomplished work and will be a foundation for my Western musicality point-of-[re]entry.

Amazon writeup:

"The Glorious Glockenspiel: A Guide to Greatness in Playing and Performing" is an extensive guide that provides a comprehensive overview of the Glockenspiel, covering everything from the instrument's history and basic music theory to advanced playing techniques and performance tips. This book is suitable for both beginners and experienced musicians who are interested in learning or improving their Glockenspiel skills.

The book begins by introducing the Glockenspiel and its benefits, followed by an overview of basic music theory, including note reading, time signatures, and rhythms. The reader is then guided through the process of assembling and tuning the Glockenspiel, as well as holding the mallets and using various striking techniques.

As the book progresses, the reader will learn advanced playing techniques, including creating different sounds, playing with dynamics and expression, and using the sustain pedal. The reader will also learn how to play melodies, arpeggios, and chords, as well as how to play in different octaves and with harmonies.

In addition to covering the technical aspects of playing the Glockenspiel, the book also explores the practicalities of playing in an ensemble, providing guidance on how to work with other musicians and follow the conductor. The reader will also receive valuable performance tips, including how to prepare for a performance, deal with nerves, and communicate with the audience.

Finally, the book concludes with a section on maintaining and repairing the Glockenspiel, as well as a list of resources for further learning, including books, videos, and online communities.

Overall, "The Glorious Glockenspiel: A Guide to Greatness in Playing and Performing" is an informative and practical guide that will provide readers with the knowledge and skills they need to become accomplished Glockenspiel players."

In truth, the work is somewhat useful, but mediocre.
