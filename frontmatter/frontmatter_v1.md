### Sri Ganapati Deva ###

This Nepali six-armed form of Sri Ganapi in dancing aspect of delight, curiously without broken tusk, has newly arrived in my home and hearth. Sri Ganesha, as the 'patron of letters' and 'patron of scribes', is close to my heart. The first archa-vigraha that I ever helf was a small, very hravy, solid and formidable, dancing Sri Ganesha, gifted ne by my first principal lover in my 20th year. I generally only remember round-a-bout or circa dates, but I may state this with an unusual certainty. 

6 armed Nepali dancing Ganapati/Ganesha: right rear top hand outstretched and raised to the level of His eyes and mouth, holds a japa-mala; the right middle-hand outstretched to the right-side holds an upraised Ankusha; whilst his lower front right-hand lowered to the left side, holds a diminutive trishula. On the left side in rear raised upper arm outstretched to the, left is holding the hatchet or axe on the level of the sahasrara; the middle left-arm is stretched out to the left and holds a gathered snare, noose or lariat; the lower front left-hand is gathered to the front of the waist between the heart and the stomach and holds what appears to be three milk-sweets upon which rests the body of the trunk with slight upraised snout at the tip. There is a flaming or possibly peacock feather halo around his head. He wears an open crown or diadem and a tuft of seven possibly peacock feathers from the fontanel. The body aureole might not be flames but vertiginous growth like a creaper. All His weight dancing is on his right left leg with bent knee and right leg raised and bent, like stepping sort of forward. His steed, the rat, is on the right, holding a milk-sweet, forward with borh hands towards the viewer. All arms have armbands and wristbands and dancing anklets. Please investigate and report in detail on all these accoutremonts and attributes and provide Sankrit Devanagari and IAST and detailed explanation of all and this aspect.

What about the specific symbolism of each specific arm invested with each specific accoutremont or attribute, on each specific side, its positioning and relationship to each other? Go deep into the iconographic tradition.

# The Sacred Architecture of Six Arms: Deep Iconographic Analysis of Ṣaḍbhuja Nṛtya Gaṇapati

## Introduction to Vertical Cosmic Hierarchy

The six-armed dancing Ganesha represents a profound synthesis of cosmic symbolism through its triadic vertical arrangement, where each pair of arms corresponds to specific levels of spiritual reality and consciousness[1][2]. This vertical hierarchy reflects the fundamental tantric understanding of three cosmic levels: the upper realm (ūrdhva loka), middle realm (madhya loka), and lower realm (adho loka), each governing different aspects of divine manifestation and human spiritual development[3][4].

## The Right Side (Dakṣiṇa Pakṣa): Solar-Masculine Principle

### Upper Right Arm - Japa Mala at Eye Level

The positioning of the **japamālā** (जपमाला) at the level of the eyes and mouth creates a direct correspondence with the **sahasrāra chakra** and the higher cognitive faculties[5][6]. This placement symbolizes the integration of devotional practice with divine vision and sacred speech. The elevation to eye level indicates that this rosary transcends mere mechanical repetition, representing instead the **manasika japa** (mental repetition) that occurs at the highest level of consciousness[7][8].

The gesture here embodies the principle of **dṛṣṭi-mantra-aikya** (unity of vision and mantra), where the devotee's sight becomes sanctified through continuous divine remembrance[6][9]. This positioning also correlates with the tantric concept of **netra-mantra** (eye-mantra), where the very act of seeing becomes a form of worship[2][10].

### Middle Right Arm - Ankusha in Horizontal Extension

The **aṅkuśa** (अङ्कुश) held in the middle right hand, extended horizontally to the right side, operates at the **anāhata chakra** level, governing the heart center and emotional equilibrium[11][12]. This positioning creates a symbolic "spiritual radius" extending the deity's influence into the devotee's psychological realm. The horizontal extension represents the deity's active engagement with removing obstacles in the material plane while maintaining connection to the spiritual center[13][14].

The elephant goad at this level specifically addresses the **manas** (mind) and **buddhi** (intellect), the two primary faculties that require divine guidance and control[3][15]. The rightward extension follows the solar path (**dakṣiṇāyana**), symbolizing the active, manifesting aspect of divine consciousness[16][17].

### Lower Right Arm - Trishula in Crossed Position

The **triśūla** (त्रिशूल) held by the lower right hand, positioned across the body toward the left side, creates a powerful diagonal energy flow that connects the **mūlādhāra chakra** with the heart center[18][19]. This crossed positioning represents the transcendence of duality through the integration of opposing forces within the devotee's energy system[20][21].

The trident at the lower level, corresponding to the earth element and foundational consciousness, signifies Ganesha's role as **Vighnakartā** (creator of obstacles for the unrighteous) and **Vighnahartā** (remover of obstacles for devotees)[22][17]. The diagonal placement creates a protective barrier against negative influences attempting to enter through the lower chakras[23][24].

## The Left Side (Vāma Pakṣa): Lunar-Feminine Principle

### Upper Left Arm - Parashu at Sahasrara Level

The **paraśu** (परशु) positioned at the **sahasrāra** level in the upper left hand represents the divine feminine aspect of destruction-through-wisdom[5][12]. This placement corresponds to the tantric principle of **Chinnamastā**, the self-severing goddess who cuts through the ego at its highest manifestation[23][20]. The axe at the crown chakra level indicates the deity's capacity to sever the subtle attachments that bind consciousness even at the highest spiritual attainments[4][25].

The leftward positioning aligns with the **iḍā nāḍī** (lunar channel), representing the receptive, wisdom aspect of consciousness that receives divine grace through surrender rather than effort[26][24]. This creates the iconographic representation of **jñāna-śakti** (wisdom-power) operating through divine receptivity[2][27].

### Middle Left Arm - Pasha in Horizontal Extension

The **pāśa** (पाश) extended horizontally to the left operates at the **viśuddha chakra** level, governing communication and the subtle binding power of divine love[6][18]. This positioning represents the "lasso of compassion" that draws devotees closer to the divine presence through the magnetic attraction of **bhakti** (devotion)[13][16].

The noose at throat level symbolizes the binding of speech to divine purpose, transforming ordinary communication into **vāk-siddhi** (perfection of speech)[9][24]. The leftward extension follows the lunar path (**uttarāyaṇa**), representing the receptive, drawing-in aspect of divine grace[5][15].

### Lower Left Arm - Modaka at Heart-Stomach Junction

The **modaka** (मोदक) held at the junction between heart and stomach corresponds to the **maṇipūra chakra** and represents the transformation of desires into spiritual nourishment[28][29]. This positioning creates a bridge between emotional satisfaction (heart) and physical nourishment (stomach), symbolizing the integration of spiritual and material fulfillment[19][15].

The sweet offering at this level represents **rasa-tattva** (the principle of divine taste), where ordinary pleasures become transmuted into spiritual bliss through the deity's grace[11][14]. The gathering of the hand "to the front of the waist" creates a receptive gesture that mirrors the devotional offering posture[6][30].

## Triadic Relationships and Energy Dynamics

### Vertical Integration: The Three Cosmic Levels

The upper pair of arms (japamālā and paraśu) operates within the **ūrdhva loka** (upper realm), governing the transcendental aspects of consciousness and the dissolution of the ego-mind[3][4]. The middle pair (aṅkuśa and pāśa) functions within the **madhya loka** (middle realm), addressing the psychological and emotional dimensions of spiritual transformation[18][23]. The lower pair (triśūla and modaka) operates within the **adho loka** (lower realm), dealing with the foundational energies and material transformation[19][20].

### Horizontal Polarization: Solar-Lunar Dynamics

The right side embodies the **piṅgalā nāḍī** (solar channel) with its emphasis on active transformation, control, and manifestation[5][16]. The left side represents the **iḍā nāḍī** (lunar channel) with its focus on receptive wisdom, compassion, and nourishment[26][24]. The central axis of the dancing form represents the **suṣumnā nāḍī** (central channel) through which the integrated energies ascend toward liberation[23][21].

### Diagonal Relationships: Cross-Currents of Grace

The positioning creates several diagonal energy relationships that represent the complex interweaving of spiritual forces. The upper right japamālā connects with the lower left modaka, creating a devotion-to-fulfillment pathway[7][28]. The upper left paraśu relates to the lower right triśūla, establishing a wisdom-to-foundation connection[22][25]. The middle arms create a horizontal balance that maintains equilibrium between active control (right) and compassionate attraction (left)[12][18].

## Sacred Geometry and Iconometric Principles

### The Hexagonal Matrix

The six arms create an invisible hexagonal pattern around the deity's torso, corresponding to the **ṣaṭkoṇa** (six-pointed star) found in tantric yantras[20][21]. This geometric configuration represents the perfect balance of ascending (male) and descending (female) triangular forces, with each arm position corresponding to a vertex of this sacred geometry[23][9].

### Proportional Relationships

According to the **Śilpa Śāstra** tradition, the arm positioning follows specific **tālamāna** (proportional measurement) principles[29][19]. Each arm's extension creates measured relationships with the deity's central axis, establishing what the texts call **saumya-ugra-saṃyoga** (the union of peaceful and fierce aspects) through balanced positioning[3][4].

### Mudric Integration

While each hand holds a specific attribute, the positioning of the arms themselves creates **mahāmudrā** effects that transcend individual hand gestures[6][9]. The overall configuration generates what the **Āgama** texts describe as **sarva-vighna-nāśana-cakra** (the wheel that destroys all obstacles) through the geometric harmony of the six positions[18][15].

## Esoteric Correspondences and Deeper Meanings

### Chakric Resonance

Each arm position creates specific resonances with the chakra system, not merely through vertical alignment but through complex harmonic relationships[26][24]. The upper arms activate the **brahma-randhra** (crown opening), the middle arms stimulate the **hṛdaya-puṇḍarīka** (heart lotus), and the lower arms ground energies through the **mūla-bandha** (root lock)[23][20].

### Tantric Significance

The six-armed configuration represents the **ṣaḍaṅga-yoga** (six-limbed yoga) in dynamic form, where each arm embodies one of the classical spiritual practices: **pratyāhāra** (withdrawal), **dhāraṇā** (concentration), **dhyāna** (meditation), **prāṇāyāma** (breath control), **niyama** (observances), and **yama** (restraints)[4][21].

### Cosmic Functionality

The arrangement creates what tantric texts describe as **viśva-vyāpaka-maṇḍala** (all-pervading sacred circle), where the deity simultaneously operates on multiple cosmic levels while maintaining perfect integration[25][15]. This represents the ultimate iconographic achievement: the visual demonstration of **sarvātmatā** (the all-self nature) of divinity[2][10].

## Conclusion: The Living Mandala

This six-armed dancing Ganesha represents far more than artistic creativity—it embodies a complete **sādhana-cakra** (spiritual practice wheel) in iconographic form[27][17]. Each arm, with its specific positioning and attribute, creates a node in a complex network of spiritual relationships that guide the devotee through all levels of transformation[3][19]. The precise positioning reflects centuries of iconographic wisdom, creating what the tradition calls **darśana-mokṣa** (liberation through vision)—the possibility of spiritual realization through contemplation of the perfect divine form[18][20].
