#### **Chapter 17: Lila-Smaranam: Remembering the Divine Play Through Music**
*   **17.1. Raga as a Narrative Landscape**
    *   17.1.1. Jnana: Associating specific ragas with specific *lilas* (divine pastimes) of Radha and Krishna. Raga Vasanta for the spring festival of Holi; Raga Desh for the monsoon rains in Vrindavan.
    *   17.1.2. Sadhana: Before playing a raga, read and meditate on a corresponding lila. Let the story guide your improvisation. You are not just playing notes; you are painting a scene from Vrindavan for your deities.
