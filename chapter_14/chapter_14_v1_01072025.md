#### **Chapter 14: Sangeet as Seva: Music as Selfless Service**
*   **14.1. The Karma Yoga of Performance**
    *   14.1.1. Jnana: The philosophy of *Nishkama Karma* (action without attachment to the fruits) from the Bhagavad Gita, applied to music. The offering is the goal, not the quality of the offering.
    *   14.1.2. Sadhana: The practice of *Arpanam* (offering). Before playing, consciously state: "This is not for my pleasure, but for Yours." After playing, do not judge the performance. Simply offer it and let it go.
