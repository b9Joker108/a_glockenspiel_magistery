### Scarborough Fair ##

The key signature that includes the flats A♭, B♭, and E♭ is that of E♭ major. Its relative minor, C minor, shares this same key signature. Traditionally, the ballad "Scarborough Fair" often appears in a modal or folk context—sometimes arranged in a mode that borrows from or is closely related to E♭ major (or its relative minor) to evoke its characteristic, timeless, slightly mysterious sound.

Below are a few points to consider and explore on your 37-key glockenspiel (spanning C5 to C8):

1. Key Signature Details:  
   - E♭ major is built on the notes: E♭ – F – G – A♭ – B♭ – C – D – E♭.  
   - These three flats (E♭, A♭, B♭) give the scale its characteristic warmth and pastoral quality — qualities
     often felt in "Scarborough Fair."  
   - On your glockenspiel, these accidentals will appear exactly as they would on any standard instrument with a       conventional 12-tone chromatic layout, so you can rely on your usual fingerings and note positions.

2. Modal Arrangement in Scarborough Fair:  
   - While many modern arrangements of the ballad may adjust the mode for a varied emotional texture, the
     traditional setting and some arrangements choose E♭ major (or its relative minor) to highlight a
     particular tonal color.  
   - The modal inflections (sometimes leaning toward a Dorian or even a mixolydian feel) that appear in folk
     traditions can be explored by slightly altering the diatonic framework while keeping the key signature
     intact. This might mean emphasizing certain scale degrees (like the raised sixth in Dorian mode) even if
     the overall accidentals remain those of E♭ major/C minor.

3. Application on Your Glockenspiel:  
   - Scoring and Composition: When composing or arranging on your glockenspiel, use the clear placement of
     the accidentals (E♭, A♭, B♭) to mark the unique open character of the key.  
   - Drills and Exercises: Consider running arpeggios that outline chords typical of E♭ major (for example,
     an E♭ major arpeggio: E♭, G, B♭, E♭) and compare them with the relative minor patterns (C minor: C, E♭, G, C)
     to get a feel for the expressive shifts.  
   - Articulation: You might experiment with how the bright yet earthy sound of the E♭ major key signature plays
     out in different registers of your instrument — from the warm lower end (closer to C5) up through the
     sparkling higher tones (approaching C8).

By understanding that the presence of A♭, B♭ and E♭ defines the E♭ major key signature (or its relative minor, C minor), you can use these drills and compositional ideas to both faithfully render the character of "Scarborough Fair" and explore new creative directions on your glockenspiel.

### Dynamics and Expression ###

mezzo piano. MET-soe pee-AH-noe. [Italian]. A dynamic mark meaning moderately soft. Not quite as soft as piano. It is abbreviated mp.

### Augmentation Dot ### 

When you place an augmentation dot immediately after a note, it increases the duration of that note by half of its original value. For example, if you have a quarter note (which normally gets one beat) with an augmentation dot, it becomes one and a half beats in duration. This practice is essential for creating rhythmic variations and more complex timing within a piece.
