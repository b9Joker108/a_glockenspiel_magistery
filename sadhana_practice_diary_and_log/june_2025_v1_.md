I spent another late night to sunrise researching and writing. So, my schedule, routine and programme are all out of whack. I discovered LilyPond, the score engraving software. It is a revelation. I was tired when it came to practice time. I resolved to have a bath with candles, sang to Sri Sri Radha-Ballabha in my home mandhir, from my bath in candlelight. Even though tired, I was more refreshed and did do my practice. But, the session was brief. I practiced scales and arpeggios. No timing drills. I practiced the second and final part of Scarborough Fair a few times. Said goodnight and went to bed. I felt good with the practice, though brief and was pleased I didn't skip it or use tiredness as an excuse to shirk. I am going for a jog upon awakening.

My long practice of yesterday, resulted in having a late dinner and then the Muses were courting me whilst I was researching and writing. All of which, resulted in a profound breakdown in my routine the following day as well as impacting on my quality of sleep. When it got to practice time, I was tired, inattentive, making the same basic errors repeatedly and I was not recalling what I had committed to memory. It was so disappointing and painful to the ear, that I cut the session a bit short. I made a vow that I would start jogging regularly prior to Winter Solstice, which is almost upon me. I need to get all my jogging clothes in order and in place and ready. I know that running and yoga impacts on my voice, my focus, my energy, my memory, my recall, my problem-solving, my endurance and many other things. So, it will impact on my acquisition of glockenspiel musicality and needsmust be brought back from the body, muscular and cellular memory archives. My practice was so disappointing, but I endeavour to learn from my mistakes rapidly and efficiently and not repeat the same errors. I also release attachment to the fruit of my sadhana. But, I commit to endeavouring to do my best in my practice sessions and keep them of a short and efficient length, with vision, to twice a day, when jogging is in stride and I have adapted to the initial discomfiture in my physicality and system from commencing a new routine in my presently unkempt and untidy state.

I practiced for almost two (2) hours this evening, with a 10-minute intermission. Too long. Inefficient. But, I was really enjoying myself and lost track of time. Dinner was really late as a result. I did my three (3) timed scale and arpeggio drills, ascending and descending for: C, G Major and D Major. I then refreshed my memory of the first two (2) percussive timing drills of the 'Cadet' Basic mock-up. Then, I put the two (2) percussive timing drills into ascending and descending modes of the scales C, G Major and D. Major. Then I progressed 'Scarborough Fair' and spent quite some time on it. I used the virtual metronome Android app 'Tick' for the entire practice session. At the end of my practice session, I almost did an entire execution of the arrangement of 'S.F.' without error.  Many, many years ago, I actually spent three (3) solid full and joyful days singing verses upon verses of all the 'S.F.' variant verses. I have not started singing them with the glock yet. I will wait till I execute 'S.F.' without error and is comitted to memory, before commencing singing the verses.

I warmed up with my new practice scale D Major in 4/4 at 70 BPM, as that was next in the Circle of Fifths from G Major and practiced arpeggios as well. Then played around with time in the scale and arpeggio, such as double time and other things. Then in D Major, practiced the first three (3) 'Basic' Sea Cadet timing and rhythm drills again. Then I moved to sight-reading and sight-playing the G Major scale and arpeggios as scored and timed in the 'Basic' Cadet glock mock-up. Then moved to beginning practicing my first piece, *Scarborough Fair*, arranged in E♭ major and 3/4 time. I did not get very far as I need to refresh my knowledge of some of the scored notation. Also, I practiced the E♭ major scale and arpeggios to familiarise myself with the key signature of the piece. I realised in this session, that I need to practice in the mornings, as well as the evenings on the one and the same day.

I just finished my third practice session. In this session, I principally did time drills and left and right-handed mallet-work, with one octave scales of G Major and some G Major arpeggios. I practiced the initial three percussion drills of the Canadian Sea Cadets 'Basic' glockenspiel required accomplishments. I will memorize the entire 'Basic' Sea Cadet glock mock-up, before progressing to 'Level One'. Also, at the end of today's session, unplanned and unrehearsed, I spontaneously went into one round of an almost complete, well-sounded and canonically-timed rendition of *Frère Jacques*, which surprised and delighted me. Next session, I will do more of the same, commence a different scale and start practicing a piece. I did just over an hour, about 1.20 minutes or 80 minutes, with a few toilet breaks. I am really working on hydrating. This week, I will also commence my jogging sadhana.
