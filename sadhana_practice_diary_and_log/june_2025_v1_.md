I practiced only scales and a very few arpeggios of what I have already practiced so far since securing the Glock. I practiced the last line staff of SF and the whole tune a very small number of times through. I practiced dampening keys with the mallet in designated timing drills, which is new. It just came to me when reading and analyzing the SF score, that it called for dampening. I realised, as the glock is resonant, a rest actually means dampening. I hadn't realised it before. Though, you can dampen piano keys with a peddle, from my dedicated daily, more than ten (10) years of practice, theory, practicals and gradings, I hardly ever used the dampening peddle. I did dampen the djembe in my three (3) years of practice in the Senegalese djembe tradition. I also flirted with the flute, violin and guitar for circa 2-3 years a-piece, but I never dampened with any of them. Dampening wwould be a technique on the guitar. I doubt it would be likely on flute. It could be on violin. Mrs Hutchins never foregrounded dampening on the piano. Scores must have called for it, as I only had two (2) years to go in order to be a qualified piano teacher. Bless her divine cotton socks. I miss her greatly. Today, I realized that I really need to bring my non-dominant hand up-to-speed. Apart from this, I did sing and dance a little today whist attending to householder chores.

I was doing householder duties in-house and out. By the time it came to a possible juncture to practice, it was late, I had been up for a very long tine and was very tired. Anyway, I did practice timing drills sounded internally in my mind's ear on a few occasions throughout tge day. I practiced the last line staff of SF.

I practiced a new scale, the Relative Key to the third dyad of the Circle of Fifths. Then, I commenced a new timing drill in that key. The new practice drill was the last rhythm and timing drill of the 'Cadet' Basic Glock mock-up. The drill was so much easily memorised than any of the first three I have been practicing, which is curious.

Upon awakening, I quickly showered, hydrated, then awakened Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha, then I went for my run. No discomfiture no significant soreness. There was after yesterday, but today it had dissapated. I picked up a new free copy of Westrip's 'Moghul Cooking', that was just abandoned or offered in my lifepath. I cooked, offered then ate my prashadam. Then, I addended to householder household duties, like cleaning whilst singing Sri Radhe Nama kirtan and dancing. I opened the front door to invite in Sri Lakshmi devi. There was a beautiful breeze and the crystal suncatcher emitted rainbows all through my entranceway hallway and on the threshold and out the front of the door. On impetus of the most beautiful and gentle breeze, I ritually hung prayer flags as torana on my interior doors and the breeze gently moved them. I had a bath in silence. Out of the silence came: (1) In LilyPond I can score and engrave entire ragas mapped to different Western Classical musical tonics, (2) generate a .midi from the LilyPond score, (3) overlay a soundfont of Sangam voice and listen and internally voice in consonance, whilst I run. I may do the same with tala and polyrhythms. It is mechanical and technical and for that reason, in lieu of a guru, it will serve the function. I let the water dry on my skin naturally to hydrate, then I clothed and went to bhajan in my mandhir. I did arpeggiated dyads or chordal dyads of different scales, so practiced mallet synchronisation and timing. It was lovely. I just made spontaneous tunes. I stopped my glock practice and resolved to do some vocal kirtan. I did that for a while and finished.

Many things vied for my attention today and when it came time to practice, I was tired again. I had a short, somewhat tokenistic session, but it went relatively well, though brief. I was only slightly sore from my jog, so all the preparatory work I put in, assisted in mitigating adaption pain. I am changing my night-time alarm for wind-down to 9pm andvaim for this to be my regular sleep time. Upon waking at 4.00 am, I will awaken Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha and go for my jog. Return and breakfast and then immediately have my first glockenspiel practice and set this as my routine. Maybe jogging every second day. We will see how well I adapt. I only did scales and arpeggios today: C Major and its relative minor A Minor; G Major and its relative minor D Minor. D Minor was a new scale and arpeggio on the glock. I have engraved a draft score of these drills with LilyPond, but have to refine and debut the code. I am new to LilyPond.

I spent another late night to sunrise researching and writing. So, my schedule, routine and programme are all out of whack. I discovered LilyPond, the score engraving software. It is a revelation. I was tired when it came to practice time. I resolved to have a bath with candles, sang to Sri Sri Radha-Ballabha in my home mandhir, from my bath in candlelight. Even though tired, I was more refreshed and did do my practice. But, the session was brief. I practiced scales and arpeggios. No timing drills. I practiced the second and final part of Scarborough Fair a few times. Said goodnight and went to bed. I felt good with the practice, though brief and was pleased I didn't skip it or use tiredness as an excuse to shirk. I am going for a jog upon awakening.

My long practice of yesterday, resulted in having a late dinner and then the Muses were courting me whilst I was researching and writing. All of which, resulted in a profound breakdown in my routine the following day as well as impacting on my quality of sleep. When it got to practice time, I was tired, inattentive, making the same basic errors repeatedly and I was not recalling what I had committed to memory. It was so disappointing and painful to the ear, that I cut the session a bit short. I made a vow that I would start jogging regularly prior to Winter Solstice, which is almost upon me. I need to get all my jogging clothes in order and in place and ready. I know that running and yoga impacts on my voice, my focus, my energy, my memory, my recall, my problem-solving, my endurance and many other things. So, it will impact on my acquisition of glockenspiel musicality and needsmust be brought back from the body, muscular and cellular memory archives. My practice was so disappointing, but I endeavour to learn from my mistakes rapidly and efficiently and not repeat the same errors. I also release attachment to the fruit of my sadhana. But, I commit to endeavouring to do my best in my practice sessions and keep them of a short and efficient length, with vision, to twice a day, when jogging is in stride and I have adapted to the initial discomfiture in my physicality and system from commencing a new routine in my presently unkempt and untidy state.

I practiced for almost two (2) hours this evening, with a 10-minute intermission. Too long. Inefficient. But, I was really enjoying myself and lost track of time. Dinner was really late as a result. I did my three (3) timed scale and arpeggio drills, ascending and descending for: C, G Major and D Major. I then refreshed my memory of the first two (2) percussive timing drills of the 'Cadet' Basic mock-up. Then, I put the two (2) percussive timing drills into ascending and descending modes of the scales C, G Major and D. Major. Then I progressed 'Scarborough Fair' and spent quite some time on it. I used the virtual metronome Android app 'Tick' for the entire practice session. At the end of my practice session, I almost did an entire execution of the arrangement of 'S.F.' without error.  Many, many years ago, I actually spent three (3) solid full and joyful days singing verses upon verses of all the 'S.F.' variant verses. I have not started singing them with the glock yet. I will wait till I execute 'S.F.' without error and is comitted to memory, before commencing singing the verses.

I warmed up with my new practice scale D Major in 4/4 at 70 BPM, as that was next in the Circle of Fifths from G Major and practiced arpeggios as well. Then played around with time in the scale and arpeggio, such as double time and other things. Then in D Major, practiced the first three (3) 'Basic' Sea Cadet timing and rhythm drills again. Then I moved to sight-reading and sight-playing the G Major scale and arpeggios as scored and timed in the 'Basic' Cadet glock mock-up. Then moved to beginning practicing my first piece, *Scarborough Fair*, arranged in E♭ major and 3/4 time. I did not get very far as I need to refresh my knowledge of some of the scored notation. Also, I practiced the E♭ major scale and arpeggios to familiarise myself with the key signature of the piece. I realised in this session, that I need to practice in the mornings, as well as the evenings on the one and the same day.

I just finished my third practice session. In this session, I principally did time drills and left and right-handed mallet-work, with one octave scales of G Major and some G Major arpeggios. I practiced the initial three percussion drills of the Canadian Sea Cadets 'Basic' glockenspiel required accomplishments. I will memorize the entire 'Basic' Sea Cadet glock mock-up, before progressing to 'Level One'. Also, at the end of today's session, unplanned and unrehearsed, I spontaneously went into one round of an almost complete, well-sounded and canonically-timed rendition of *Frère Jacques*, which surprised and delighted me. Next session, I will do more of the same, commence a different scale and start practicing a piece. I did just over an hour, about 1.20 minutes or 80 minutes, with a few toilet breaks. I am really working on hydrating. This week, I will also commence my jogging sadhana.
