I practiced for almost two (2) hours this evening, with a 10-minute intermission. Too long. Inefficient. But, I was really enjoying myself and lost track of time. Dinner was really late as a result. I did my three (3) timed scale and arpeggio drills, ascending and descending for: C, G Major and D Major. I then refreshed my memory of the first two (2) percussive timing drills of the 'Cadet' Basic mock-up. Then, I put the two (2) percussive timing drills into ascending and descending modes of the scales C, G Major and D. Major. Then I progressed 'Scarborough Fair' and spent quite some time on it. I used the virtual metronome Android app 'Tick' for the entire practice session. At the end of my practice session, I almost did an entire execution of the arrangement of 'S.F.' without error.  Many, many years ago, I actually spent three (3) solid full and joyful days singing verses upon verses of all the 'S.F.' variant verses. I have not started singing them with the glock yet. I will wait till I execute 'S.F.' without error and comitted to memory, before commencing singing the verses.

I warmed up with my new practice scale D Major in 4/4 at 70 BPM, as that was next in the Circle of Fifths from G Major and practiced arpeggios as well. Then played around with time in the scale and arpeggio, such as double time and other things. Then in D Major, practiced the first three (3) 'Basic' Sea Cadet timing and rhythm drills again. Then I moved to sight-reading and sight-playing the G Major scale and arpeggios as scored and timed in the 'Basic' Cadet glock mock-up. Then moved to beginning practicing my first piece, *Scarborough Fair*, arranged in E♭ major and 3/4 time. I did not get very far as I need to refresh my knowledge of some of the scored notation. Also, I practiced the E♭ major scale and arpeggios to familiarise myself with the key signature of the piece. I realised in this session, that I need to practice in the mornings, as well as the evenings on the one and the same day.

I just finished my third practice session. In this session, I principally did time drills and left and right-handed mallet-work, with one octave scales of G Major and some G Major arpeggios. I practiced the initial three percussion drills of the Canadian Sea Cadets 'Basic' glockenspiel required accomplishments. I will memorize the entire 'Basic' Sea Cadet glock mock-up, before progressing to 'Level One'. Also, at the end of today's session, unplanned and unrehearsed, I spontaneously went into one round of an almost complete, well-sounded and canonically-timed rendition of *Frère Jacques*, which surprised and delighted me. Next session, I will do more of the same, commence a different scale and start practicing a piece. I did just over an hour, about 1.20 minutes or 80 minutes, with a few toilet breaks. I am really working on hydrating. This week, I will also commence my jogging sadhana.
