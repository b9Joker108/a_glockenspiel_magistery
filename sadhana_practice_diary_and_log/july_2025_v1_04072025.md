Today, I approached a modicum of productivity. I set the resolve to programme gentle kicking of a soccer-ball in-stride to strengthen my knees. It may be a few weeks till I commence, but I will secure one on the morrow.

**Technical Term for Gentle In-Stride Ball Kicking**

When you jog alongside a moving ball and lightly strike it with your instep — essentially using each kick as a dynamic knee-extension strengthening exercise — you’re engaging in two (2) overlapping concepts:

1. In Soccer Coaching
- Instep Volley Drill  
  Volleying the ball in stride before it hits the ground, using the “laces” (instep) of your foot.  
- Ground Passing on the Run  
  Executing light passes against a wall or back to yourself while moving, often called “pass-and-follow” or “jog-and-kick” drills.

2. In Sports-Rehab Terminology
- Open Kinetic Chain Knee Extension  
  The foot moves freely in space while the knee extends concentrically—akin to kicking a ball.  
- Concentric Quadriceps Strengthening  
  Each instep kick contracts the quadriceps to extend the knee, strengthening the muscle group dynamically.

**Putting It All Together**

- If you’re explaining it to a coach:  
  “I’ll be doing an instep volley drill—lightly volleying the ball in stride to work on my touch and build knee strength.”

- If you’re documenting it as an exercise in a rehab or training plan:  
  “Open kinetic-chain, concentric knee extension via instep kicking against a moving ball.”

Want to refine your drill with progressive resistance, adjust your strike technique, or integrate it into a broader knee-stability program? Let me know, and we can dive deeper into programming variables, safety cues, and progression strategies.

**The “Out-Step” in Soccer**

In soccer coaching and anatomy, the counterpart to the laces (instep) strike is generally called the outside of the foot. Here’s how it breaks down:

1. Common Coaching Term
- Outside of the foot  
  The lateral border—from the little-toe side up toward the ankle—used for curved passes and swerving shots.
- Passes/shots using this surface are often called  
  - “Outside-of-the-foot passes”  
  - “Outside-foot curlers”

2. Anatomical/Technical Descriptor
- Lateral aspect of the foot  
  In anatomy, the “out-step” is the lateral border, overlying the heads of the fifth metatarsal and the cuboid bone.
- In more formal rehab or biomechanics notes, you might see  
  - “Lateral foot strike”  
  - “Lateral border contact”

Would you like drills to master curling the ball with your outside foot, or tips on building consistency and spin? Let me know, and we’ll map out a progression!

**Are you sure it is volley, I was of the understanding that soccer used the same term as basketball: dribbling?**

**Distinguishing “Volley” from “Dribbling” in Soccer**

**What Is a Volley**

A volley occurs when you strike the ball in midair, before it touches the ground.  

- You can use various surfaces: instep (laces), outside of the foot, or even the thigh.  
- Commonly practiced against a wall or from a lofted pass to train first-time finishing and ball control under pressure.  

**What Is Dribbling**

Dribbling means moving with the ball at your feet, maintaining close control through a series of touches.  

- You use the inside, outside, sole, or even heel to keep the ball within playing distance as you run.  
- It’s akin to “bouncing” the ball downfield in basketball, but without letting it leave the ground.  

**Why They’re Not the Same**

- A volley is a single, airborne strike aimed at passing, shooting, or redirecting the ball.  
- Dribbling is a continuous sequence of ground touches that lets you carry and maneuver the ball.  

**Putting It into Practice**

1. To train volleys: serve or toss the ball to yourself and strike it before it bounces.  
2. To train dribbling: set up cones and weave through them, using varied surfaces of your foot.  

Curious about specific drills to master either skill? Let me know, and I can outline session plans, progression tips, and common coaching cues.

**Sports-Rehab Terminology for Soccer Dribbling**

**Closed Kinetic Chain Neuromuscular Task**
  
Soccer dribbling is a continuous closed kinetic-chain activity in which the foot remains in intermittent contact with the ground while controlling a moving ball. Each touch requires coordinated joint motions at the ankle, knee, and hip, engaging multiple muscle groups to stabilize and propel both body and ball.

**Joint and Muscle Dynamics**

- Ankle complex  
  - Rapid dorsiflexion/plantarflexion cycles for ball manipulation  
  - Eversion/inversion adjustments to guide ball trajectory  
- Knee joint  
  - Controlled flexion during weight acceptance  
  - Concentric quadriceps drive during push-off for forward momentum  
- Hip joint  
  - Dynamic abduction/adduction for lateral cuts  
  - Rotational stability via gluteus medius and deep rotators  

**Proprioceptive and Balance Loading**

Dribbling imposes high proprioceptive demands as the player continuously recalibrates foot position against an unpredictable stimulus (the ball). This enhances:

- Ankle and knee joint proprioceptors  
- Neuromuscular coordination for reactive balance  
- Feed-forward and feedback motor control loops  

**Concentric–Eccentric Muscle Cycling**

Each dribble touch alternates between muscle lengthening and shortening to both cushion impact and generate force:

- Eccentric control in tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius during ball contact  
- Concentric phase in peroneals and intrinsic foot muscles to redirect the ball  

**Training Variables and Progressions**

- Surface hardness  
  - Grass → Turf → Sand to increase proprioceptive challenge  
- Ball weight/pressure  
  - Standard → Slightly deflated for greater muscle control  
- Speed and complexity  
  1. Stationary ball taps  
  2. Slow-paced weaving through cones  
  3. Reactive dribble under dual-task conditions (e.g., visual or cognitive load)  

Whether you’re rehabbing an ankle sprain or emphasizing dynamic knee stability, framing dribbling as a closed-chain, proprioceptive-rich task helps you integrate it seamlessly into a phased rehab or performance program. Let me know if you’d like sample session outlines or specific progressions.

**Exercise and Sports Sciences Terminology for Soccer Dribbling**

**Skill Classification**

Soccer dribbling is an externally paced, continuous, open skill requiring ongoing perceptual-motor adjustments as the performer and ball interact within a dynamic environment.  

- Task Type: Continuous serial task  
- Environmental Context: Open, unpredictable  
- Pace: Externally paced

**Biomechanical Analysis**

Dribbling can be broken into a cyclic sequence of support and swing phases, each with specific joint kinematics and kinetics:  

| Phase            | Joints & Motions                                   | Primary Muscle Actions                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Support (Contact)| Ankle plantarflexion → dorsiflexion                  | Eccentric tibialis anterior, soleus      |
|                  | Knee flexion → extension                             | Eccentric hamstrings → concentric quads  |
|                  | Hip flexion → extension                              | Eccentric gluteals → concentric quads    |
| Swing (Recovery) | Hip flexion → prepare for next contact               | Concentric iliopsoas, rectus femoris     |
|                  | Knee flexion → then extension                        | Concentric hamstrings → quads            |
|                  | Ankle plantarflexion → position for next touch       | Concentric gastrocnemius, peroneals      |

**Physiological Profile**

Dribbling challenges multiple energy pathways through intermittent high-intensity bursts amid lower-intensity recovery:  

- Aerobic system: 60–70% of total energy over match play  
- Anaerobic alactic (ATP-PCr): powering explosive accelerations and decelerations  
- Anaerobic lactic (glycolytic): supporting sustained high-velocity duels  

**Neuromuscular & Motor Control Demands**

Dribbling trains sensorimotor integration and dynamic stability in multi-planar contexts:  

- Proprioceptive acuity across ankle, knee, hip joints  
- Feed-forward motor planning for anticipated ball trajectory  
- Feedback corrections for unplanned ball deflections  
- Reactive balance: center-of-mass adjustments over changing base-of-support  

**Training Variables & Constraint Manipulation**

Adjust these parameters to progress dribbling proficiency and physiological loading:  

- Task Constraints  
  - Ball size/pressure (standard → reduced pressure)  
  - Dribble speed (slow → maximal sprint dribble)  
  - Ball speed (self-toss → partner feed → machine feed)  
- Environmental Constraints  
  - Surface type (grass → turf → unstable surface)  
  - Space availability (wide open → tight corridors)  
- Individual Constraints  
  - Visual or cognitive load (counting tasks, auditory cues)  
  - Fatigue state (fresh → pre-fatigue to simulate match conditions)  

Whether you’re designing a performance development plan or integrating dribbling into a periodized training cycle, framing it with these exercise-science constructs ensures targeted adaptation in biomechanics, physiology, and motor control.

**The First “Dribbling” Usage**

The term “dribble” in its sports sense: “to give the ball a slight shove or bounce”, first appears in association football (soccer) in 1863. Basketball’s version of dribbling doesn’t emerge until around 1892, when players began “passing to themselves” and bouncing the ball to advance it.

My night-sweats were significant again. I don't feel at all sick. To my knowledge, I don't have an infection, but the body runs hot at night for an abundance of different reasons and it is uncommon for me to have them. Last night, it took me a vast amount of time to take refuge in Swapna Dashana due to the what I feel may be the adrenaline generated and circulating in my bodymind system and metabolism due to instituting new physicality programming. So, I took respite in meditation and pranayama until the veil-of-sleep descended, for lack of a better descriptive. I dismissed 'Vedic Awaken' and continued to sleep well into the morning. My bodymind system demanded it. Upon waking naturally, I set the Hydrogen kettle and showered, awoke Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha and offered them all the usual suspects and bhoga of half a Ruby Red Grapefruit. I then hydrated with 500 mls of 45º Celcius Hydrogen water augmented with the freshly extracted juice of half a large lemon and a pinch of salt-of-quality. Then, honoured the Prashadam in the Lila of a Grapefruit, followed by the Mahaprashadam of Same. Whilst I was breakfasting, I watched and listened to two (2) exceptionally well-read men, who too, write exceptionally well, inadvertently affirm, that there is always more to learn and know as neither of them were privy to Engineering discourse in the English, otherwise they would know that the received and technical pronunciation of "conduit", rhymes with "circuit". But, not many people know this. Today, is my birthday. The vicious joint inflammation in both knees has yielded to no pain in the right and no pain but slight tightness and stiffness in the left. Today, I learnt a new English word that I have never encountered before: [idiolect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiolect). For my birthday, today, I received a used hardcopy of the English translation of the '[Yoga-Yajna-Valkya-Samhita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Yajnavalkya)' (Sanskrit: योगयाज्ञवल्क्य, Yoga-Yājñavalkya) by [T.K.V. Desikachar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._K._V._Desikachar). I have made a deep and protracted study of most of the traditional primary sources of the Yoga Darshana, particularly Hatha, but not this one. Now, I have a facsimile of a manuscript and three (3) English renderings and I will proceed with it when reclaiming Ashtanga Yoga Darshan sadhana in the near future. I am just honouring some Prashadam in the Lila of Black Tea with Milk, grated Ginger Rhizome and Raw Honey and then I am onway onfoot on this beautiful clear and sunny Midwinter's day, to the premier spiritual bookshop in my vicinity for a birthday present proper. The walk will hopefully be rehabilitory for my left knee and the day is far too beautiful to err on the side of caution and be sedentary and remain indoors. I started out limping due to the left knee and going up and down stairs supported by the bannisters and like a crab: sideways. But, my intuition and gamble paid off as it got progressively better being worked and I returned home, walking up and down stairs unassisted and without a limp. I ended up purchasing a Taschen. I have always admired their quality, finesse, strong production values and bounty of exquisite colour plates for which they are lauded. I purchased a 2024 hardcover edition of 'Witchcraft' edited by Hundley & Grossman, which is a collection of essays by various writers. I paid too much for it, but not a foolish amount and it wasn't particularly expensive for a Taschen and was a very rare impulsive treat and it was what presented itself to me with the beauty of its cover. All thst glitters.... I just secured a digital copy as well, but I value having the hard copy for different kinds of Bibliomancy. I also took myself out for a film. I saw a French film, mostly in English at a small boutique arthouse cinema on-whim, entitled: '[Jane Austen Wrecked My Life (French: Jane Austen a gâché ma vie)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen_Wrecked_My_Life)'. It was a derivative, approaching stock, romance - but no less enjoyable for that. It was well executed. I had a good birthday. I value my solitude in my early old age. I got so little done today, yet again and visitors or socialization would just impact on my productivity even further. Once I stabilize my knees and am running without much adverse reactivity, I will commence decompressing all my joints and spine, due to running and giriwork, as standard, and commence hip-openning. No Giri, no Glock, only tokenistic cleaning: Lady Luck will not be pleased.

## Wednesday, July 2, 2025 ##

I was not sure if The Holy Powers would lend me the facility of my former Voice which They Granted. But, whilst researching and writing this volume from circa 12.00am - circa 3.00am and spontaneously vocalizing with whatever randomly played on YouTube, it was ['Beautiful Pain'](https://github.com/b9Joker108/a_glockenspiel_magistery/blob/main/scores_compositions_arrangements_and_fragments/vocal_warm_ups_and_ornamentation_practice/beautiful_pain_v1_02072025.md), that I have never heard before, that affirmed that I would be given facility. They are so Merciful and Gracious. I had a restful day yesterday, but not much sleep. That said, I did have Swapna Darshan and was awoken abruptly a few times from sleep due to hypnopompic Dream Sounds in the clinical subtype of 'Exploding Head Syndrome':

**Hypnagogic and Hypnopompic Auditory Hallucinations**

When you experience sounds—such as voices, buzzing, or loud bangs—during sleep transitions, the technical term is:

* Hypnagogic auditory hallucinations: sounds perceived as you’re falling asleep (sleep-onset).  
* Hypnopompic auditory hallucinations: sounds perceived as you’re waking up (sleep-offset).  

These phenomena fall under the broader category of hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, which can involve any sensory modality (visual, tactile, etc.) and occur during the threshold between wakefulness and sleep. A specific subtype of hypnopompic auditory hallucinations is Exploding Head Syndrome, characterized by hearing sudden loud noises: like explosions, crashes, or cymbals, that aren’t real and often jolt the sleeper awake. Although alarming, it’s benign and usually requires no treatment beyond sleep hygiene improvements.

**Why They Occur**

1. Neural Sleep Transitions  
   During hypnagogia and hypnopompia, your brain shifts between wakeful (Alpha/Beta waves) and sleep (Theta/Delta waves) states. This asynchronous activity may generate phantom sensory experiences, including sounds.  
2. Sleep Deprivation and Stress  
   Both increase the frequency and vividness of these hallucinations.  
3. Sleep Disorders  
   Conditions like narcolepsy and insomnia often present with more hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations.
