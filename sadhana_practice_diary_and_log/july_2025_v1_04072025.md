Today, I approached a modicum of productivity. I set the resolve to programme gentle kicking of a soccer-ball in-stride to strengthen my knees. It may be a few weeks till I commence, but I will secure one on the morrow.

**Technical Term for Gentle In-Stride Ball Kicking**

When you jog alongside a moving ball and lightly strike it with your instep — essentially using each kick as a dynamic knee-extension strengthening exercise — you’re engaging in two (2) overlapping concepts:

1. In Soccer Coaching
- Instep Volley Drill  
  Volleying the ball in stride before it hits the ground, using the “laces” (instep) of your foot.  
- Ground Passing on the Run  
  Executing light passes against a wall or back to yourself while moving, often called “pass-and-follow” or “jog-and-kick” drills.

2. In Sports-Rehab Terminology
- Open Kinetic Chain Knee Extension  
  The foot moves freely in space while the knee extends concentrically—akin to kicking a ball.  
- Concentric Quadriceps Strengthening  
  Each instep kick contracts the quadriceps to extend the knee, strengthening the muscle group dynamically.
