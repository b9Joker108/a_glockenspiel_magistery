Chapter One

On the first of the three (3) days of the fullmoon, Tuesday, June 12, 2025, I received my 37 tone glockenspiel. It starts at C4, one octave higher than Middle C, C3. Scientific Pitch Notation (SPN) is identified on each tonal bar of the glockenspiel. I wish to sing devotional kirtans and bhajans in Sanskrit and Bengali to my archa-vigraha of my ishta-devatas Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha (Sri Radharani Devi and Bhagavan Sri Krishna). I wish to sing and play in appropriate ragas and taalas, with appropriate rhythms and melody. I have resolved as a general rule, to practice ragas only at their traditionally designated times according to the Hindustani musical tradition, which has the most developed raga time-theory of the Indian Classical/Devotional musical traditions. I need to know how to transcribe, score and write my own scores, in a way that subsumes best practices of the Indian and Western musical traditions. I can read Western music and have done pianoforte gradings in theory and practice, long ago. I am a long-lapsed pianist, but I practiced and played solidly for circa eight (8) years, from six (6) years of age. I have established an intention to practice the glockenspiel for 30 minutes per day. Currently, 6pm is my dedicated time. Sov the focus is to be on ragas appropriate for the first period of evening. I need a well grounded curriculum for the next three months. I also need to be able to at least play and sing a simple kirtan or bhajan ASAP and build on it. Meld traditional best practice from Indian and Western musical tradition, with attested science, such as mnemonic theory, amongst others. I am rarely spoken and reserved in speech, but have realised many, many years of devotional kirtan and bhajan call-and-response sadhana, to my beloved deities. I am principally auditary in nature and am also profoundly somatic and kinaesthetic in learning modalities. I need to structure a well rounded curriculum and daily practice that establishes a thorough and well-grounded foundation.

The goal of this chapter is not a general grounding and foundation in the musicality and technique of glockenspiel acquisition - that will be discussed subsequently. It is a three (3) month curriculum of a dedicated evening thirty (30) minute practice-performance, focused on learning and the devotional kirtan and bhajan of ragas and taalas traditionally appropriate for this time of early evening, for cultivating my devotion and for the delight of the archa-vigrahas of my ishta-devatas, Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha (Sri Radharani Devi and Bhagavan Sri Krishna), amongst others. This will document my own learning, acquisition, challenges and successes, for both my own edification and that of others who may follow.

I feel the glockenspiel, with its clear, bell-like tones, though non-traditional, may be a wonderful instrument for devotional kirtan and bhajan *sadhana*. I will utilize a suite of different Generative Artificial Intelligence models to assist in my learning and acquisition endeavour and to assist in writing this work. But all generated content, in time, will be rigorously edited and its efficacy will be charted by my nsprogressions, successes and challenges. I will endeavour to ground this work in traditional Indian musicality, as well as traditional Western musicality, both informed by attested and defensible science, such as mnemonic theory, and forground my principal learning modalities of auditory/orality and kinaesthetic/somatic to build a curriculum that honours my devotional goal, learning style and the sacred traditions of Indian and Western classical music.

This plan is designed to be a thorough, well-grounded foundation that melds tradition with practical, modern learning techniques.

### **Part 1: The Groundwork - Understanding Your Tools**

Before we begin the 3-month plan, we must establish our core concepts. This is the foundation upon which everything is built.

#### **1. Your Instrument: The Glockenspiel as a Swara-Kshetra (Field of Notes)**

Your glockenspiel has fixed pitches. This is both a challenge and a blessing. The challenge is that you cannot produce the slides (*meend*) and microtonal variations (*shrutis*) that are characteristic of Indian vocal or string music. The blessing is that it provides a crystal-clear, perfectly-tuned reference for each note (*swara*), which is excellent for ear training (*swara-gyan*).

We will focus on what the glockenspiel does beautifully: **Swaras (melody) and Laya (rhythm).**

#### **2. Swaras: The Seven Notes of the Soul**

Indian music uses a system of solfege called **Sargam**. Your starting note, C5 (one octave above Middle C), will be our **Sa (Shadja)**, the immovable tonic.

Here is the mapping of the 12 musical notes from Western to Indian systems. You must internalize this.

| Scientific Pitch | Western Note | Indian Swara (Sargam) | Type | Mnemonic Association |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C5** | **C** | **Sa (षड्ज)** | **Shuddha (Natural)** | The foundation, your spiritual home |
| C#5 | C# | Komal Re (कोमल ऋषभ) | Vikrit (Altered) | Tender, questioning |
| **D5** | **D** | **Shuddha Re (शुद्ध ऋषभ)** | **Shuddha (Natural)** | Rising, bright |
| D#5 | D#/Eb | Komal Ga (कोमल गन्धार) | Vikrit (Altered) | Pleading, compassionate |
| **E5** | **E** | **Shuddha Ga (शुद्ध गन्धार)**| **Shuddha (Natural)** | Joyful, open |
| **F5** | **F** | **Shuddha Ma (शुद्ध मध्यम)** | **Shuddha (Natural)** | Stable, calming |
| F#5 | F# | Teevra Ma (तीव्र मध्यम) | Vikrit (Altered) | Intense, searching, sharp |
| **G5** | **G** | **Pa (पञ्चम)** | **Shuddha (Natural)** | Fulfilled, resonant |
| G#5 | G#/Ab | Komal Dha (कोमल धैवत) | Vikrit (Altered) | Somber, introspective |
| **A5** | **A** | **Shuddha Dha (शुद्ध धैवत)**| **Shuddha (Natural)** | Assured, devotional |
| A#5 | A#/Bb | Komal Ni (कोमल निषाद) | Vikrit (Altered) | Yearning, intimate |
| **B5** | **B** | **Shuddha Ni (शुद्ध निषाद)**| **Shuddha (Natural)** | Ethereal, reaching |
| **C6** | **C** | **Taar Sa (तार षड्ज)** | **Higher Octave Sa** | The culmination, release |

**Somatic/Kinaesthetic Exercise:** Play each note on your glockenspiel while singing its Sargam name ("Sa," "Re," "Ga"...). *Feel* the vibration of the note and your voice. Associate the feeling with the mnemonic.

#### **3. Raga and Prahara (Time Theory)**

Your practice time of 6 pm falls into the **first Prahara of the night** (approx. 6 pm - 9 pm). This is a *sandhi-prakash* or "twilight" period. The ragas for this time are serene, devotional, and foundational. Our curriculum will focus exclusively on these.

**Our Ragas for the next 3 months:**
*   **Month 1: Raga Yaman.** The king of evening ragas. Peaceful and majestic.
*   **Month 2: Raga Bhupali.** A beautiful, simple pentatonic raga. Sweet and meditative.
*   **Month 3: Raga Kedar.** A slightly more complex and deeply devotional evening raga.

#### **4. Taala: The Cosmic Rhythm**

Taala is the rhythmic cycle. For a somatic and kinaesthetic learner, this is key. We will learn to feel the cycle in our bodies.

*   **Matra:** The beat.
*   **Vibhag:** Measures or sections of the cycle.
*   **Sam:** The first beat of the cycle. It is the point of arrival and emphasis. Represented by a clap or a stressed beat.
*   **Khali:** The "empty" beat, often the midpoint of the cycle. It's a wave of the hand, a point of release and anticipation. Represented by a wave.

We will start with the most common taala: **Teentaal (16 matras)**.
Cycle: 16 beats, divided into 4 vibhags of 4 beats each.
Structure: Clap, Clap, Wave, Clap.
`| 1  2  3  4 | 5  6  7  8 | 9  10 11 12 | 13 14 15 16 |`
`|     X      |     2      |      0       |      3      |`
(X = Sam, 2/3 = Taali/Clap, 0 = Khali/Wave)

**Kinaesthetic Practice:** Put on a Teentaal track from a Taala app. Just sit and clap the pattern: **CLAP**-2-3-4, **CLAP**-2-3-4, **WAVE**-2-3-4, **CLAP**-2-3-4. Feel the cycle.

#### **5. Scoring: The Hybrid Method**

This system will give you everything you need: precise pitch, duration, Indian note names, and rhythmic context.

*   **Use Western Staff Notation:** For pitch (notes on the staff) and duration (quarter note, half note, etc.).
*   **Write Sargam Below:** Under each notehead, write its Sargam name (S, R, G, m, P, etc. - use lowercase for Komal swaras and 'm' for Teevra Ma).
*   **Write Taala Markings Below the Staff:** Indicate the matra number and the bol (rhythmic syllable) if you know it. Mark the Sam (X) and Khali (0).

**Example: A simple phrase in Raga Yaman in Teentaal**

### **Part 2: Your Three-Month Curriculum**

**Daily 30-Minute Practice Structure (Sadhana):**

*   **(5 mins) Centering & Swara-Sthapana (Placing the Note):**
    *   Light a candle or incense for your archa-vigraha. Offer a short prayer.
    *   Turn on a Tanpura drone app set to C# (the traditional key, though we use C) or C. This is your auditory anchor.
    *   Sing and play only **Sa (C5)**. Hold the note. Feel it resonate in your chest and head. This is called *kharaj practice* and is vital. Find your perfect unison with the instrument.
*   **(10 mins) Alankar & Taala Practice (Somatic/Kinaesthetic Drills):**
    *   This is pattern practice. It builds muscle memory in your hands and vocal cords.
*   **(10 mins) Raga & Bhajan Practice (Melodic & Devotional):**
    *   Work on the specific raga of the month and the bhajan. This is the heart of your offering.
*   **(5 mins) Closing & Gratitude:**
    *   Sing the bhajan one last time as a pure offering.
    *   Offer gratitude to Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha, the musical tradition, and yourself for showing up.

---

### **Month 1: The Foundation - Raga Yaman**

**Raga Yaman:** The quintessential evening raga. It brings a feeling of peace, devotion (*bhakti rasa*), and majesty.
*   **Swaras used:** All Shuddha (natural) notes, except for an **Teevra Ma (m)**. So: S R G m P D N S'.
*   **Aroha (Ascent):** 'N R G m P D N S' (the low Ni is often used to approach Sa)
*   **Avaroha (Descent):** S' N D P m G R S
*   **Pakad (Catchphrase):** 'N R G R S, or P m G R S

**Weeks 1-2: Internalizing the Swaras**
*   **Alankar Practice:** Play and sing these patterns. Go slowly. Focus on clean, clear notes.
    1.  `SRG, RGM, GMm, MmP, MPD, PDN, DNS'` (and reverse)
    2.  `SRGR, GMGm, MPMP...` (and reverse)
    3.  `S R G m, R G m P, G m P D...` (and reverse)
*   **Goal:** To be able to play and sing the Aroha and Avaroha of Yaman from memory, in tune, without hesitation.

**Weeks 3-4: Bringing in Rhythm & Your First Bhajan**
*   **Taala Practice:** Play the Alankars from Weeks 1-2 *in Teentaal*. One note per beat (matra). Start the pattern on **Sam** (the first beat). Feel the arrival.
*   **Your First Bhajan: "Achyutam Keshavam"**
    *   This is a beautiful, simple bhajan that sits perfectly in Raga Yaman.
    *   **Lyrics & Simple Melody (Sargam):**
        *   _A-chyu-tam Ke-sha-vam Krish-na Da-mo-da-ram_
        *   `P P P | m P D P | G m P G | R S - - |`
        *   _Raa-ma Naa-raa-ya-nam Jaa-na-kii Va-lla-bham_
        *   `P P P | m P D P | G m P G | R S - - |`
    *   **Kinaesthetic/Auditory Learning:**
        1.  Listen to a simple version of this bhajan on YouTube repeatedly. Absorb the melody.
        2.  Sing the Sargam `P P P, m P D P...` while tapping out Teentaal.
        3.  Play just the melody on your glockenspiel. Your hands will learn the pattern.
        4.  Sing the words while playing the melody.
        5.  Finally, try to sing and play together. This is your goal for Month 1.

### **Month 2: Deepening the Practice - Raga Bhupali**

**Raga Bhupali:** A pentatonic (5-note) raga, its simplicity is its beauty. It evokes a deep, sweet, meditative mood.
*   **Swaras used:** S R G P D S' (Ma and Ni are omitted)
*   **Aroha (Ascent):** S R G P D S'
*   **Avaroha (Descent):** S' D P G R S
*   **Pakad (Catchphrase):** G R S, 'D S R G, P G D P G R S

**Weeks 5-6: Exploring the Pentatonic Space**
*   **Alankar Practice:** Create new patterns with only these 5 notes.
    1.  `SRG, RGP, GPD, PDS'` (and reverse)
    2.  `S R P G, R G D P, G P S' D` (this pattern involves jumps, excellent for practice)
    3.  Practice holding each note (S---, R---, G---) for 4 beats each. This is called **Alaap**. It's slow, non-rhythmic improvisation. Explore pairs of notes: S-R, R-G, S-G, G-P...

**Weeks 7-8: Simple Composition & Expression**
*   **Goal:** Learn a simple composition (*bandish* or *chota khyal*) in Bhupali.
*   **Simple Bandish in Teentaal:** "Prabhu Ji Deva"
    *   **Sthayi (First Part):**
        *   _Pra-bhu Ji De-va, Su-ra-pa-ti Pa-la-ka_
        *   `G G P D | S' S' D P | G G R S | D S R - |`
    *   **Antara (Second Part):**
        *   _Gaa-va-ta Ba-ja-va-ta, Su-kha-da Ya-ka_
        *   `P P D S' | R' S' D P | G G R S | D S R - |`
*   **Practice:** Use the same method as in Month 1. Listen, sing sargam, play melody, sing words, then combine. Focus on the feeling of sweetness and devotion.

---

### **Month 3: Consolidation & Expansion - Raga Kedar**

**Raga Kedar:** Also an evening raga, related to Yaman but with a more complex, meandering character. It has a strong feeling of devotion and longing.
*   **Swaras used:** S R G m P D N. It uses both Shuddha Ma (M) and Teevra Ma (m). The path is not straight.
*   **Aroha (Ascent):** S M, M P, D P, N D S'
*   **Avaroha (Descent):** S' N D P, m P D P, M P G, R S
*   **Pakad (Catchphrase):** S M, M P, m P D P M, R S

**Weeks 9-10: Mastering the Phrases**
*   **Focus:** Kedar is about its unique phrases, not a straight scale. Practice these phrases repeatedly on the glockenspiel while singing the sargam.
    1.  `S - M - | M P - -`
    2.  `m P D P | M - R S`
    3.  `P P S' - | N D P -`
*   This is more challenging. Be patient. The goal is to make these signature phrases feel natural.

**Weeks 11-12: Introducing a New Taala & Kirtan**
*   **New Taala: Keherwa (8 beats)**. Very common in kirtan.
    *   Cycle: 8 beats, 2 vibhags of 4. `| 1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 |`
    *   Bols: Dha Ge Na Ti Na Ka Dhi Na
    *   Pattern: **CLAP**-2-3-4, **WAVE**-2-3-4
*   **Kirtan:** Find a simple "Sri Krishna Chaitanya / Prabhu Nityananda" kirtan or a simple "Radhe Radhe" chant. Many of these naturally fall into Raga Kedar or Yaman and use Keherwa taal.
*   **Goal:** Play the main melody of a kirtan in Keherwa taal. Your focus this month is on integrating a new rhythm and feeling the more complex emotional landscape of Kedar. Start by just playing the `S M` phrase of Kedar on the `1 - 2` beat, and the `R S` on the `5 - 6` beat to get a feel for it.

### **Essential Tools & Resources**

1.  **Tanpura App (Auditory Anchor):** iTablaPro (iOS/Android) or Tanpura Droid (Android). This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Always practice with it.
2.  **Taala App (Rhythmic Anchor):** iTablaPro also has this. Or LehraBox.
3.  **Listening (Auditory Learning):**
    *   **Raga Yaman:** Listen to vocalists like Pandit Jasraj, Kishori Amonkar. For a similar instrumental timbre, listen to **Pandit Shivkumar Sharma** on the Santoor. The Santoor is a struck string instrument and will be a great inspiration for how to play these ragas on a percussive instrument like a glockenspiel.
    *   **Raga Bhupali & Kedar:** Same artists. Their renditions are benchmarks.
4.  **A Notebook:** Keep a practice journal. Note down what felt good, what was difficult. Write out your scores using the hybrid method. This act of writing solidifies learning.

This curriculum is a deep well. Be gentle with yourself. The goal for the first three months is not perfection, but to establish a consistent, loving, and intentional practice (*sadhana*). You are building a relationship with the Swaras, with the Ragas, and through them, with Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha. The joy is in the daily offering.


Section 2: Transcription and Scoring

Both transcription and scoring are new to me, but I feel called to make these a part of my kirtan and bhajan sadhana with the glockenspiel. 



Chapter One

On the first of the three (3) days of the fullmoon, Tuesday, June 12, 2025, I received my 37 tone glockenspiel. It starts at C4, one octave higher than Middle C, C3. Scientific Pitch Notation (SPN) is identified on each tonal bar of the glockenspiel. I wish to sing devotional kirtans and bhajans in Sanskrit and Bengali to my archa-vigraha of my ishta-devatas Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha (Sri Radharani Devi and Bhagavan Sri Krishna).

This plan is designed to be a thorough, well-grounded foundation that melds tradition with practical, modern learning techniques.

### **Part 1: The Groundwork - Understanding Your Tools**

Before we begin the 3-month plan, we must establish our core concepts. This is the foundation upon which everything is built.

#### **1. Your Instrument: The Glockenspiel as a Swara-Kshetra (Field of Notes)**

Your glockenspiel has fixed pitches. This is both a challenge and a blessing. The challenge is that you cannot produce the slides (*meend*) and microtonal variations (*shrutis*) that are characteristic of Indian vocal or string music. The blessing is that it provides a crystal-clear, perfectly-tuned reference for each note (*swara*), which is excellent for ear training (*swara-gyan*).

We will focus on what the glockenspiel does beautifully: **Swaras (melody) and Laya (rhythm).**

#### **2. Swaras: The Seven Notes of the Soul**

Indian music uses a system of solfege called **Sargam**. Your starting note, C5 (one octave above Middle C), will be our **Sa (Shadja)**, the immovable tonic.

Here is the mapping of the 12 musical notes from Western to Indian systems. You must internalize this.

| Scientific Pitch | Western Note | Indian Swara (Sargam) | Type | Mnemonic Association |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C5** | **C** | **Sa (षड्ज)** | **Shuddha (Natural)** | The foundation, your spiritual home |
| C#5 | C# | Komal Re (कोमल ऋषभ) | Vikrit (Altered) | Tender, questioning |
| **D5** | **D** | **Shuddha Re (शुद्ध ऋषभ)** | **Shuddha (Natural)** | Rising, bright |
| D#5 | D#/Eb | Komal Ga (कोमल गन्धार) | Vikrit (Altered) | Pleading, compassionate |
| **E5** | **E** | **Shuddha Ga (शुद्ध गन्धार)**| **Shuddha (Natural)** | Joyful, open |
| **F5** | **F** | **Shuddha Ma (शुद्ध मध्यम)** | **Shuddha (Natural)** | Stable, calming |
| F#5 | F# | Teevra Ma (तीव्र मध्यम) | Vikrit (Altered) | Intense, searching, sharp |
| **G5** | **G** | **Pa (पञ्चम)** | **Shuddha (Natural)** | Fulfilled, resonant |
| G#5 | G#/Ab | Komal Dha (कोमल धैवत) | Vikrit (Altered) | Somber, introspective |
| **A5** | **A** | **Shuddha Dha (शुद्ध धैवत)**| **Shuddha (Natural)** | Assured, devotional |
| A#5 | A#/Bb | Komal Ni (कोमल निषाद) | Vikrit (Altered) | Yearning, intimate |
| **B5** | **B** | **Shuddha Ni (शुद्ध निषाद)**| **Shuddha (Natural)** | Ethereal, reaching |
| **C6** | **C** | **Taar Sa (तार षड्ज)** | **Higher Octave Sa** | The culmination, release |

**Somatic/Kinaesthetic Exercise:** Play each note on your glockenspiel while singing its Sargam name ("Sa," "Re," "Ga"...). *Feel* the vibration of the note and your voice. Associate the feeling with the mnemonic.

#### **3. Raga and Prahara (Time Theory)**

Your practice time of 6 pm falls into the **first Prahara of the night** (approx. 6 pm - 9 pm). This is a *sandhi-prakash* or "twilight" period. The ragas for this time are serene, devotional, and foundational. Our curriculum will focus exclusively on these.

**Our Ragas for the next 3 months:**
*   **Month 1: Raga Yaman.** The king of evening ragas. Peaceful and majestic.
*   **Month 2: Raga Bhupali.** A beautiful, simple pentatonic raga. Sweet and meditative.
*   **Month 3: Raga Kedar.** A slightly more complex and deeply devotional evening raga.

#### **4. Taala: The Cosmic Rhythm**

Taala is the rhythmic cycle. For a somatic and kinaesthetic learner, this is key. We will learn to feel the cycle in our bodies.

*   **Matra:** The beat.
*   **Vibhag:** Measures or sections of the cycle.
*   **Sam:** The first beat of the cycle. It is the point of arrival and emphasis. Represented by a clap or a stressed beat.
*   **Khali:** The "empty" beat, often the midpoint of the cycle. It's a wave of the hand, a point of release and anticipation. Represented by a wave.

We will start with the most common taala: **Teentaal (16 matras)**.
Cycle: 16 beats, divided into 4 vibhags of 4 beats each.
Structure: Clap, Clap, Wave, Clap.
`| 1  2  3  4 | 5  6  7  8 | 9  10 11 12 | 13 14 15 16 |`
`|     X      |     2      |      0       |      3      |`
(X = Sam, 2/3 = Taali/Clap, 0 = Khali/Wave)

**Kinaesthetic Practice:** Put on a Teentaal track from a Taala app. Just sit and clap the pattern: **CLAP**-2-3-4, **CLAP**-2-3-4, **WAVE**-2-3-4, **CLAP**-2-3-4. Feel the cycle.

#### **5. Scoring: The Hybrid Method**

This system will give you everything you need: precise pitch, duration, Indian note names, and rhythmic context.

*   **Use Western Staff Notation:** For pitch (notes on the staff) and duration (quarter note, half note, etc.).
*   **Write Sargam Below:** Under each notehead, write its Sargam name (S, R, G, m, P, etc. - use lowercase for Komal swaras and 'm' for Teevra Ma).
*   **Write Taala Markings Below the Staff:** Indicate the matra number and the bol (rhythmic syllable) if you know it. Mark the Sam (X) and Khali (0).

**Example: A simple phrase in Raga Yaman in Teentaal**

### **Month 1: The Foundation - Raga Yaman**

**Raga Yaman:** The quintessential evening raga. It brings a feeling of peace, devotion (*bhakti rasa*), and majesty.
*   **Swaras used:** All Shuddha (natural) notes, except for an **Teevra Ma (m)**. So: S R G m P D N S'.
*   **Aroha (Ascent):** 'N R G m P D N S' (the low Ni is often used to approach Sa)
*   **Avaroha (Descent):** S' N D P m G R S

### **Month 2: Deepening the Practice - Raga Bhupali**

**Raga Bhupali:** A pentatonic (5-note) raga, its simplicity is its beauty. It evokes a deep, sweet, meditative mood.
*   **Swaras used:** S R G P D S' (Ma and Ni are omitted)
*   **Aroha (Ascent):** S R G P D S'
*   **Avaroha (Descent):** S' D P G R S
*   **Pakad (Catchphrase):** G R S, 'D S R G, P G D P G R S

**Weeks 5-6: Exploring the Pentatonic Space**
*   **Alankar Practice:** Create new patterns with only these 5 notes.
    1.  `SRG, RGP, GPD, PDS'` (and reverse)
    2.  `S R P G, R G D P, G P S' D` (this pattern involves jumps, excellent for practice)
    3.  Practice holding each note (S---, R---, G---) for 4 beats each. This is called **Alaap**. It's slow, non-rhythmic improvisation. Explore pairs of notes: S-R, R-G, S-G, G-P...

**Weeks 7-8: Simple Composition & Expression**
*   **Goal:** Learn a simple composition (*bandish* or *chota khyal*) in Bhupali.
*   **Simple Bandish in Teentaal:** "Prabhu Ji Deva"
    *   **Sthayi (First Part):**
        *   _Pra-bhu Ji De-va, Su-ra-pa-ti Pa-la-ka_

        *   `P P D S' | R' S' D P | G G R S | D S R - |`
*   **Practice:** Use the same method as in Month 1. Listen, sing sargam, play melody, sing words, then combine. Focus on the feeling of sweetness and devotion.

---

### **Month 3: Consolidation & Expansion - Raga Kedar**

**Raga Kedar:** Also an evening raga, related to Yaman but with a more complex, meandering character. It has a strong feeling of devotion and longing.
*   **Swaras used:** S R G m P D N. It uses both Shuddha Ma (M) and Teevra Ma (m). The path is not straight.
*   **Aroha (Ascent):** S M, M P, D P, N D S'
*   **Avaroha (Descent):** S' N D P, m P D P, M P G, R S
*   **Pakad (Catchphrase):** S M, M P, m P D P M, R S

**Weeks 9-10: Mastering the Phrases**
*   **Focus:** Kedar is about its unique phrases, not a straight scale. Practice these phrases repeatedly on the glockenspiel while singing the sargam.
    1.  `S - M - | M P - -`
    2.  `m P D P | M - R S`
    3.  `P P S' - | N D P -`
*   This is more challenging. Be patient. The goal is to make these signature phrases feel natural.

**Weeks 11-12: Introducing a New Taala & Kirtan**
*   **New Taala: Keherwa (8 beats)**. Very common in kirtan.
    *   Cycle: 8 beats, 2 vibhags of 4. `| 1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 |`
    *   Bols: Dha Ge Na Ti Na Ka Dhi Na
    *   Pattern: **CLAP**-2-3-4, **WAVE**-2-3-4
*   **Kirtan:** Find a simple "Sri Krishna Chaitanya / Prabhu Nityananda" kirtan or a simple "Radhe Radhe" chant. Many of these naturally fall into Raga Kedar or Yaman and use Keherwa taal.
*   **Goal:** Play the main melody of a kirtan in Keherwa taal. Your focus this month is on integrating a new rhythm and feeling the more complex emotional landscape of Kedar. Start by just playing the `S M` phrase of Kedar on the `1 - 2` beat, and the `R S` on the `5 - 6` beat to get a feel for it.

### **Essential Tools & Resources**

1.  **Tanpura App (Auditory Anchor):** iTablaPro (iOS/Android) or Tanpura Droid (Android). This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Always practice with it.
2.  **Taala App (Rhythmic Anchor):** iTablaPro also has this. Or LehraBox.
3.  **Listening (Auditory Learning):**
    *   **Raga Yaman:** Listen to vocalists like Pandit Jasraj, Kishori Amonkar. For a similar instrumental timbre, listen to **Pandit Shivkumar Sharma** on the Santoor. The Santoor is a struck string instrument and will be a great inspiration for how to play these ragas on a percussive instrument like a glockenspiel.
    *   **Raga Bhupali & Kedar:** Same artists. Their renditions are benchmarks.
4.  **A Notebook:** Keep a practice journal. Note down what felt good, what was difficult. Write out your scores using the hybrid method. This act of writing solidifies learning.

This curriculum is a deep well. Be gentle with yourself. The goal for the first three months is not perfection, but to establish a consistent, loving, and intentional practice (*sadhana*). You are building a relationship with the Swaras, with the Ragas, and through them, with Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha. The joy is in the daily offering.


Section 2: Transcription and Scoring

Both transcription and scoring are new to me, but I feel called to make these a part of my kirtan and bhajan sadhana with the glockenspiel. 


Chapter One

On the first of the three (3) days of the fullmoon, Tuesday, June 12, 2025, I received my 37 tone glockenspiel. It starts at C4, one octave higher than Middle C, C3. Scientific Pitch Notation (SPN) is identified on each tonal bar of the glockenspiel. I wish to sing devotional kirtans and bhajans in Sanskrit and Bengali to my archa-vigraha of my ishta-devatas Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha (Sri Radharani Devi and Bhagavan Sri Krishna). I wish to sing and play in appropriate ragas and taalas, with appropriate rhythms and melody. I have resolved as a general rule, to practice ragas only at their traditionally designated times according to the Hindustani musical tradition, which has the most developed raga time-theory of the Indian Classical/Devotional musical traditions. I need to know how to transcribe, score and write my own scores, in a way that subsumes best practices of the Indian and Western musical traditions. I can read Western music and have done pianoforte gradings in theory and practice, long ago. I am a long-lapsed pianist, but I practiced and played solidly for circa eight (8) years, from six (6) years of age. I have established an intention to practice the glockenspiel for 30 minutes per day. Currently, 6pm is my dedicated time. Sov the focus is to be on ragas appropriate for the first period of evening. I need a well grounded curriculum for the next three months. I also need to be able to at least play and sing a simple kirtan or bhajan ASAP and build on it. Meld traditional best practice from Indian and Western musical tradition, with attested science, such as mnemonic theory, amongst others. I am rarely spoken and reserved in speech, but have realised many, many years of devotional kirtan and bhajan call-and-response sadhana, to my beloved deities. I am principally auditary in nature and am also profoundly somatic and kinaesthetic in learning modalities. I need to structure a well rounded curriculum and daily practice that establishes a thorough and well-grounded foundation.

The goal of this chapter is not a general grounding and foundation in the musicality and technique of glockenspiel acquisition - that will be discussed subsequently. It is a three (3) month curriculum of a dedicated evening thirty (30) minute practice-performance, focused on learning and the devotional kirtan and bhajan of ragas and taalas traditionally appropriate for this time of early evening, for cultivating my devotion and for the delight of the archa-vigrahas of my ishta-devatas, Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha (Sri Radharani Devi and Bhagavan Sri Krishna), amongst others. This will document my own learning, acquisition, challenges and successes, for both my own edification and that of others who may follow.

I feel the glockenspiel, with its clear, bell-like tones, though non-traditional, may be a wonderful instrument for devotional kirtan and bhajan *sadhana*. I will utilize a suite of different Generative Artificial Intelligence models to assist in my learning and acquisition endeavour and to assist in writing this work. But all generated content, in time, will be rigorously edited and its efficacy will be charted by my nsprogressions, successes and challenges. I will endeavour to ground this work in traditional Indian musicality, as well as traditional Western musicality, both informed by attested and defensible science, such as mnemonic theory, and forground my principal learning modalities of auditory/orality and kinaesthetic/somatic to build a curriculum that honours my devotional goal, learning style and the sacred traditions of Indian and Western classical music.

This plan is designed to be a thorough, well-grounded foundation that melds tradition with practical, modern learning techniques.

### **Part 1: The Groundwork - Understanding Your Tools**

Before we begin the 3-month plan, we must establish our core concepts. This is the foundation upon which everything is built.

#### **1. Your Instrument: The Glockenspiel as a Swara-Kshetra (Field of Notes)**

Your glockenspiel has fixed pitches. This is both a challenge and a blessing. The challenge is that you cannot produce the slides (*meend*) and microtonal variations (*shrutis*) that are characteristic of Indian vocal or string music. The blessing is that it provides a crystal-clear, perfectly-tuned reference for each note (*swara*), which is excellent for ear training (*swara-gyan*).

We will focus on what the glockenspiel does beautifully: **Swaras (melody) and Laya (rhythm).**

#### **2. Swaras: The Seven Notes of the Soul**

Indian music uses a system of solfege called **Sargam**. Your starting note, C5 (one octave above Middle C), will be our **Sa (Shadja)**, the immovable tonic.

Here is the mapping of the 12 musical notes from Western to Indian systems. You must internalize this.

| Scientific Pitch | Western Note | Indian Swara (Sargam) | Type | Mnemonic Association |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C5** | **C** | **Sa (षड्ज)** | **Shuddha (Natural)** | The foundation, your spiritual home |
| C#5 | C# | Komal Re (कोमल ऋषभ) | Vikrit (Altered) | Tender, questioning |
| **D5** | **D** | **Shuddha Re (शुद्ध ऋषभ)** | **Shuddha (Natural)** | Rising, bright |
| D#5 | D#/Eb | Komal Ga (कोमल गन्धार) | Vikrit (Altered) | Pleading, compassionate |
| **E5** | **E** | **Shuddha Ga (शुद्ध गन्धार)**| **Shuddha (Natural)** | Joyful, open |
| **F5** | **F** | **Shuddha Ma (शुद्ध मध्यम)** | **Shuddha (Natural)** | Stable, calming |
| F#5 | F# | Teevra Ma (तीव्र मध्यम) | Vikrit (Altered) | Intense, searching, sharp |
| **G5** | **G** | **Pa (पञ्चम)** | **Shuddha (Natural)** | Fulfilled, resonant |
| G#5 | G#/Ab | Komal Dha (कोमल धैवत) | Vikrit (Altered) | Somber, introspective |
| **A5** | **A** | **Shuddha Dha (शुद्ध धैवत)**| **Shuddha (Natural)** | Assured, devotional |
| A#5 | A#/Bb | Komal Ni (कोमल निषाद) | Vikrit (Altered) | Yearning, intimate |
| **B5** | **B** | **Shuddha Ni (शुद्ध निषाद)**| **Shuddha (Natural)** | Ethereal, reaching |
| **C6** | **C** | **Taar Sa (तार षड्ज)** | **Higher Octave Sa** | The culmination, release |

**Somatic/Kinaesthetic Exercise:** Play each note on your glockenspiel while singing its Sargam name ("Sa," "Re," "Ga"...). *Feel* the vibration of the note and your voice. Associate the feeling with the mnemonic.

#### **3. Raga and Prahara (Time Theory)**

Your practice time of 6 pm falls into the **first Prahara of the night** (approx. 6 pm - 9 pm). This is a *sandhi-prakash* or "twilight" period. The ragas for this time are serene, devotional, and foundational. Our curriculum will focus exclusively on these.

**Our Ragas for the next 3 months:**
*   **Month 1: Raga Yaman.** The king of evening ragas. Peaceful and majestic.
*   **Month 2: Raga Bhupali.** A beautiful, simple pentatonic raga. Sweet and meditative.
*   **Month 3: Raga Kedar.** A slightly more complex and deeply devotional evening raga.

#### **4. Taala: The Cosmic Rhythm**

Taala is the rhythmic cycle. For a somatic and kinaesthetic learner, this is key. We will learn to feel the cycle in our bodies.

*   **Matra:** The beat.
*   **Vibhag:** Measures or sections of the cycle.
*   **Sam:** The first beat of the cycle. It is the point of arrival and emphasis. Represented by a clap or a stressed beat.
*   **Khali:** The "empty" beat, often the midpoint of the cycle. It's a wave of the hand, a point of release and anticipation. Represented by a wave.

We will start with the most common taala: **Teentaal (16 matras)**.
Cycle: 16 beats, divided into 4 vibhags of 4 beats each.
Structure: Clap, Clap, Wave, Clap.
`| 1  2  3  4 | 5  6  7  8 | 9  10 11 12 | 13 14 15 16 |`
`|     X      |     2      |      0       |      3      |`
(X = Sam, 2/3 = Taali/Clap, 0 = Khali/Wave)

**Kinaesthetic Practice:** Put on a Teentaal track from a Taala app. Just sit and clap the pattern: **CLAP**-2-3-4, **CLAP**-2-3-4, **WAVE**-2-3-4, **CLAP**-2-3-4. Feel the cycle.

#### **5. Scoring: The Hybrid Method**

This system will give you everything you need: precise pitch, duration, Indian note names, and rhythmic context.

*   **Use Western Staff Notation:** For pitch (notes on the staff) and duration (quarter note, half note, etc.).
*   **Write Sargam Below:** Under each notehead, write its Sargam name (S, R, G, m, P, etc. - use lowercase for Komal swaras and 'm' for Teevra Ma).
*   **Write Taala Markings Below the Staff:** Indicate the matra number and the bol (rhythmic syllable) if you know it. Mark the Sam (X) and Khali (0).

**Example: A simple phrase in Raga Yaman in Teentaal**

### **Part 2: Your Three-Month Curriculum**

**Daily 30-Minute Practice Structure (Sadhana):**

*   **(5 mins) Centering & Swara-Sthapana (Placing the Note):**
    *   Light a candle or incense for your archa-vigraha. Offer a short prayer.
    *   Turn on a Tanpura drone app set to C# (the traditional key, though we use C) or C. This is your auditory anchor.
    *   Sing and play only **Sa (C5)**. Hold the note. Feel it resonate in your chest and head. This is called *kharaj practice* and is vital. Find your perfect unison with the instrument.
*   **(10 mins) Alankar & Taala Practice (Somatic/Kinaesthetic Drills):**
    *   This is pattern practice. It builds muscle memory in your hands and vocal cords.
*   **(10 mins) Raga & Bhajan Practice (Melodic & Devotional):**
    *   Work on the specific raga of the month and the bhajan. This is the heart of your offering.
*   **(5 mins) Closing & Gratitude:**
    *   Sing the bhajan one last time as a pure offering.
    *   Offer gratitude to Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha, the musical tradition, and yourself for showing up.

Section 2: Transcription and Scoring

Both transcription and scoring are new to me, but I feel called to make these a part of my kirtan and bhajan sadhana with the glockenspiel. 

The first application I endeavoured to assist in the process of transcription and scoring is an Android application called 'Nail the Pitch - Vocal Monitor' by Autumn Rock Software Development. It is a simple and straightforward application with a clear and specific functionality and purpose. As I wish to export what I record in the application, a modest one-off payment was required. It exports in either .wav or .midi file extensions.

'Nail the pitch' in a musical context means to sing or play a note correctly, with the right pitch or frequency. It's about achieving the exact sound that is required or intended, demonstrating accuracy and skill. 

Elaboration:

Pitch:
In music, pitch refers to how high or low a note sounds, which is determined by its frequency.

Nailing the Pitch:
This phrase implies successfully hitting the precise frequency of a note, without being too high or too low. It suggests accuracy and a good sense of pitch.

Importance in Music:
Having a good ear for pitch and being able to nail the pitch is crucial for musicians and singers. It ensures that music sounds harmonious and accurate.

Examples:
A singer "nails the pitch" when they sing a note at the exact frequency written in the sheet music.
A musician "nails the pitch" when they play an instrument and produce the correct sound for a given note.
