Baishnaba Mahajana Padabali (Bidyapati - padabali), British Library, EAP781/1/3/44, https://eap.bl.uk/archive-file/EAP781-1-3-44

This vandanam or prayer-song is taken from Image 19.

Yes, the headings do attribute the work to Vidyapati. Here's a closer look at the two headings:

- বিদ্যাপতির পদাবলী  
  This title literally means "The Songs of Vidyapati." In the Bengali literary tradition, "পদাবলী" refers to a collection or body of poetic compositions, and when prefixed with "বিদ্যাপতির," it specifies that these songs are attributed to Vidyapati. His reputation as a celebrated devotional and lyrical poet makes this a strong indicator of authorship or at least association with his poetic legacy.

- বন্দনা  
  The subheading "বন্দনা" typically denotes a form of devotional hymn or praise. In Vidyapati’s oeuvre, devotional compositions are a common and cherished genre. This further supports the notion that the text is presented as part of his work, whether as a direct original or as a translated/poetic rendering aligned with his stylistic and thematic tradition.

Thus, the combination of these headings signals that the text is understood within the tradition of Vidyapati's compositions, aligning it with his devotional and lyrical themes.

3. An “academic” pronunciation guide (approximated in IPA)

---

Each verse weaves together themes of time, beauty, and divine union.
