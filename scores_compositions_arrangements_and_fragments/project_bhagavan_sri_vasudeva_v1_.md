Is there a vocal prayer to Vasudeva (Krishna) in Sanskrit of a few verses?

Yes, there are several short vocal prayers to Vasudeva (Krishna) in Sanskrit, consisting of just a few verses. Two widely recited examples are:

**1. कृष्णाय वासुदेवाय हरये परमात्मने ।  
प्रणतः क्लेशनाशाय गोविंदाय नमो नमः ॥**

*Transliteration:*  
kṛṣṇāya vāsudevāya haraye paramātmane |  
praṇataḥ kleśanāśāya govindāya namo namaḥ ||

*Meaning:*  
Salutations to Krishna, son of Vasudeva, Hari, the Supreme Soul. Again and again we bow to Govinda, destroyer of the suffering of those who surrender[1][3][6].

**2. वसुदेवसुतं देवं कंसचाणूरमर्दनम् ।  
देवकी परमानन्दं कृष्णं वन्दे जगद्गुरुम् ॥**

*Transliteration:*  
vasudevasutaṃ devaṃ kaṃsacāṇūramardanam |  
devakī paramānandaṃ kṛṣṇaṃ vande jagadgurum ||

*Meaning:*  
I bow to Krishna, son of Vasudeva, divine Lord, destroyer of Kamsa and Chanura, supreme joy of Devaki, teacher of the universe[2].

Both are concise, melodious, and suitable for vocal prayer or chanting. Longer prayers, such as the *Vasudeva Stotram* and *Vasudeva Sthuthi*, are also available if you seek more elaborate verses[5][8].
