# Voices in the Sky #

I have secured two (2) scores of Hayward's 'Voices in the Sky' (VITS). It will be a pure delight to arrange, score and engrave for orkestral klokkenspel and my voice. I may even quill a few more verses with the help of my allies. This song brings to heart and mind the exquisite medicine bundle of so many precious and holy things and the epiphany of complex emotions. It reminds me of 'The Blue Bird [of Happiness]' with Shirley Temple, filmed as a response and answer to the beloved 'The Wizard of Oz' (TWoOZ). I find Temple saccharin and grinding in everything but this. To me, in this performance, Temple is a revelation. The storyteller in me even holds it in greater esteem than TWoOZ. To me, it invokes the importance of telling the stories, the teaching stories and particularly, telling the stories of the Ancestors. VITS is empowered songwriting. To me, it is a *magnum opus* and I invoke all denotations of the term and collapse them into unity with precision and purpose. It also reminds and evokes in me, the complex, perplexing and wrenching emotions I felt whilst reading and re-reading Wilde's 'The Nightingale and the Rose'. The Blue Bird is so very important to the Din√©, the Navajo. This song, when I heard it for the first time, I still remember the profundity of being transfixed and transubstantiated by the experience. I heard the Voice and experienced the Vision of a Navajo Dreamer. The same person who introduced me to this song, also introduced me to Sheila Chandra. They were a generation my senior.
