I first heard 'The Jesus and Mary Chain' cover and the Hoodoo of the lyrics mesmerized me. My Uncle Geoge Tillett, a lover, skipper and fashioner, of fiberglass sweetwater speedboats and a truckie based in Shepparton, Victoria, Australia, used to always call me Bo Diddley and I had no idea who that was and because it seemed like I should know, I never asked. 

Dedication: Uncle George
