A hommage to both Harrison as initiator of a profoundly beautiful song and Simone as fulfillment of the promise and my first true girlfriend Belinda, who sung it to me one morning as she awoke me drawing the blinds, after having made love in the early morning. I had never heard the song before. It became one that I most love to sing.
