A hommage to both Harrison as initiator of a profoundly beautiful song and Simone as fulfillment of the promise and my first true girlfriend Belinda, who sung it to me early one morning as she awoke me drawing the blinds, after we having made love in the early morning hours before the rising Sun. I had never heard the song before. It became one that I most love to sing.
