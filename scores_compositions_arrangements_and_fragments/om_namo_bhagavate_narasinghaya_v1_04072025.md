### Contextualization

#### Scriptural Source and Function

This mantra is found in the **Śrīmad Bhāgavatam** (5.18.8), where it is offered by the boy-saint Prahlāda to Lord Narasiṁha, the man-lion avatāra of Viṣṇu[1][2][3]. It is a powerful protective prayer (kavacha) used in Vaishnava tradition, especially for dispelling fear, overcoming obstacles, and requesting the destruction of internal and external negativity.

#### Theological and Ritual Significance

- **Invocation of Narasimha:**  
  Narasiṁha embodies both wrathful power and supreme compassion—he is the destroyer of evil (as in the slaying of Hiraṇyakaśipu) and the protector of devotees.
- **Tejas-tejase:**  
  The mantra acknowledges Narasiṁha as the source of all spiritual potency, asking him to appear in his most manifest, radiant form.
- **Vajra-nakha, vajra-daṁṣṭra:**  
  The thunderbolt imagery emphasizes his irresistible, indestructible force—his nails and teeth are the tools of cosmic justice.
- **Karmāśayān randhaya randhaya:**  
  The devotee petitions Narasiṁha to destroy the deep-seated karmic seeds (karmāśaya) that bind the soul to repeated birth and suffering.
- **Tamo grasa grasa:**  
  Darkness (tamas) here refers to ignorance and delusion. The prayer asks Narasiṁha to “devour” this darkness, clearing the way for spiritual realization.
- **Abhayam abhayam ātmani bhūyiṣṭhā:**  
  The ultimate fruit is fearlessness (abhaya) established in the heart (ātman), granted by the Lord’s presence.
- **Oṁ kṣraum:**  
  “Kṣraum” is the bīja (seed) mantra of Narasiṁha, encapsulating his essence and invoked for protection and empowerment.

#### Devotional and Practical Use

This prayer is traditionally recited by devotees seeking protection, purification, and the eradication of deep-rooted fears and desires. It is especially prominent during **Narasimha Jayanti** and in times of distress or spiritual challenge. The mantra’s structure—invocation, praise, petition for destruction of obstacles, and blessing of fearlessness—makes it a complete soteriological formula, aligning the devotee with the transformative, liberating power of the divine.

#### Summary

This Narasiṁha mantra is a succinct, potent invocation that encapsulates the dual nature of the deity as both destroyer of evil and giver of fearlessness. Its recitation is an act of surrender and empowerment, seeking the Lord’s intervention to overcome the deepest obstacles—both internal (ignorance, karma) and external (fear, adversity)—on the path to spiritual freedom[1][2][3].
