# Chöd (w/- The Seven Line Prayer) #

The Chöd arranged, chanted and enacted by H.E. my Dharmarajji Gurudeva, begins with 'The Seven Line Prayer', an invocation to Padmasambhava, the "Lotus-Born". It should be noted, that of all the prayers and invocations to the great adept of Oddiyana, embodiment of all Samyaksambuddhas of the 'Three Times' (Sanskrit: xxx; IAST: xxx; Tibetan: xxx; EWTS: xxx), that is: past, present and future, the invocation composed of seven 'vajra' or adamantine verses is a magisterial sublimation.

Mipham the Great (1846 - 1912)
"There is no need to get bogged down in the complexities of the kyerim and things like that which we don't really understand. Simply doing this practice [the Seven-Line Prayer] alone is sufficient."

H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche (1904 -1987)
"In the future during the darkest of times — although there exists a great variety of beneficent buddhas and deities — invoking me, Orgyen Padma Jungne, will bring the greatest benefit."

Padmasambhava
