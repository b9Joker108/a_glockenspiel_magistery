# Chöd (w/- The Seven Line Prayer) #

The Chöd arranged, chanted and enacted by H.E. my Dharmarajji Gurudeva, begins with 'The Seven Line Prayer' (Tibetan: xxx; EWTS: xxx), an invocation to Padmasambhava, the "Lotus-Born". It should be noted, that of all the prayers and invocations to the great adept of Oddiyana, embodiment of all Samyaksambuddhas of the 'Three Times' (Sanskrit: त्रिकाल; IAST: trikāla; Tibetan: དུས་གསུམ་; EWTS: dus gsum), that is: past, present and future, the invocation composed of seven (7) 'vajra' or adamantine verses is a magisterial sublimation.

Mipham the Great (1846 - 1912)
"There is no need to get bogged down in the complexities of the kyerim and things like that which we don't really understand. Simply doing this practice [the Seven-Line Prayer] alone is sufficient."

H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche (1904 -1987)
"In the future during the darkest of times — although there exists a great variety of beneficent buddhas and deities — invoking me, Orgyen Padma Jungne, will bring the greatest benefit."

Certainly, Beauford. Here's a GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) rendering of select passages from the Chöd text, styled for readability and ritual clarity:

Let me know if you'd like this segmented into a collapsible GFM outline, a printable format, or interlinear with phonetic and meaning annotations. You could even assign symbols to specific bell or damaru beats for integration with your performance workflow.


Below is an example of how you might render the two distinct damaru drumbeat–invocation passages from the Chöd text in GitHub‐flavored Markdown. In the tables below each “verse” is split into several columns: a tentative reconstruction of the Tibetan Uchen (i.e. traditional script), the corresponding EWTS (Extended Wylie Transliteration) form, an approximate academic IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) rendering, a “drumbeat alignment” line that shows how rhythmic (damaru) strikes are meant to fall in tandem with each syllable, the layperson’s (romanized) pronunciation as given in the text, an English translation, and finally some brief interlinear annotations commenting on the symbolic role of each segment. (Keep in mind that the Uchen and EWTS renderings are approximations intended to convey fidelity to the oral tradition; scholars or practitioners may refine these further.)

Damaru Sequence 1: The “Machigma la solwa deb” Invocation

This section is repeated three times, each time with a different opening/closing syllable (“OM”, “AH”, then “HUM”) but with the same core phrase.

Segment  Uchen (Tibetan)  EWTS  IPA (Academic)  Drumbeat Alignment  Layperson’s Pronunciation  English Translation  Interlinear Annotation
Row 1: “OM Machigma la solwa deb OM”  ཨོཾ  མ་ཆིཀྱམ་ལ་  སོལ་ཝ་དེབ  ཨོཾ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  om ma.chik.yam la sol.wa deb om  /oːm maˈt͡ʃik.jam la soˈlʷa deb oːm/  <pre>OM  Machi  gma  la  sol  wa  deb  OM
(“thum” hit)   (even stroke)   (light tap)   (tap)   (tick)   (tac)   (tap)   (thum)</pre> | OM Machigma la solwa deb OM                 | I pray to the One Mother             | OM: Sacred opening/closing syllable. “Machigma la solwa deb” functions as the core invocatory formula.                              |
Row 2: “AH Machigma la solwa deb AH”  ཨཧ  མ་ཆིཀྱམ་ལ་  སོལ་ཝ་དེབ  ཨཧ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ah ma.chik.yam la sol.wa deb ah  /aːh maˈt͡ʃik.jam la soˈlʷa deb aːh/  <pre>AH  Machi  gma  la  sol  wa  deb  AH
(slight “thum”)   (even stroke)   (light tap)   (tap)   (tick)   (tac)   (tap)   (slight thum)</pre>  | AH Machigma la solwa deb AH                 | I pray to the One Mother             | AH: A variant vocalization that, while patterned like the “OM” line, offers a nuanced dynamic in the invocation.                        |
Row 3: “HUM Machigma la solwa deb HUM”  ཧུམ  མ་ཆིཀྱམ་ལ་  སོལ་ཝ་དེབ  ཧུམ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  hum ma.chik.yam la sol.wa deb hum  /huːm maˈt͡ʃik.jam la soˈlʷa deb huːm/  <pre>HUM  Machi  gma  la  sol  wa  deb  HUM
(emphatic hit)   (even stroke)   (light tap)   (tap)   (tick)   (tac)   (tap)   (emphatic hit)</pre> | HUM Machigma la solwa deb HUM               | I pray to the One Mother             | HUM: The climactic syllable that brings the invocatory cycle to a decisive close; its weight signals culmination.                       |

Note on “Drumbeat Alignment”: The above in-line breakdown is a notational aid. Syllables are “hit” with a characteristic damaru strike (here rendered in parenthesis as qualities such as “thum,” “tac,” etc.) so that the rhythmic pattern aligns closely with the vocalization.

Damaru Sequence 2: The Color‐Specific Invocations

A second damaru set introduces color‐coded invocations, each beginning with an adjective (“Karpo” [white], “Marpo” [red], “Ngonpo” [blue]) that designates a particular energetic quality.

Segment  Uchen (Tibetan)  EWTS  IPA (Academic)  Drumbeat Alignment  Layperson’s Pronunciation  English Translation  Interlinear Annotation
Row 4: “Karpo OM gyi jin gyi lob”  དཀར་པོ  ཨོཾ་གྱི་  འཇིན་འཇི་ལོབ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  dkar po om gyi 'jin gyi lob  /ˈkɑr.po om gi ˈdʑin gi lob/  <pre>Karpo  OM  gyi  jin  gyi  lob
(“ka-” light beat for “white”)  (deep hit)  (steady)  (tap)  (steady)  (tap)</pre>           | Karpo OM gyi jin gyi lob                         | Bless me through the white OM                    | Karpo: “White” designates purity; the ensuing phrase is the damaru invocatory formula.                                                        |
Row 5: “Marpo AH yi jin gyi lob”  དམར་པོ  ཨཧ་ཡི་འཇིན་འཇི་ལོབ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  marpo ah yi 'jin gyi lob  /ˈmɑr.po ah ji ˈdʑin gi lob/  <pre>Marpo  AH  yi  jin  gyi  lob
(“mar-” vibrates for “red”)  (softer hit)  (pulse)  (tap)  (pulse)  (tap)</pre>                   | Marpo AH yi jin gyi lob                           | Bless me through the red AH                      | Marpo: “Red” evokes dynamic energy and passion; the structure parallels the white formula but with a distinct tonal quality.                     |
Row 6: “O Ngonpo HUM gi jin gyi lob”  ཨོ  ངོན་པོ  ཧུམ་གྱི་  འཇིན་འཇི་ལོབ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  o ngon po hum gyi 'jin gyi lob  /oʊ ŋon.po hum gi ˈdʑin gi lob/  <pre>O Ngonpo  HUM  gi  jin  gyi  lob
(“o” gentle open)  (“ngonpo” with calm beat)  (resonant hit)  (tap)  (even)  (tap)</pre>                 | O Ngonpo HUM gi jin gyi lob                        | Bless me through the blue HUM                    | Ngonpo: “Blue” suggests wisdom and tranquility; the closing “HUM” carries an emphatic, meditative weight.                                       |

Again, the “Drumbeat Alignment” column uses a schematic (in monospace formatting) to indicate how a performer might “mark” each syllable with a damaru strike; in practice, these beats would align with the natural rhythm of the chant.

Final Notes

- Extending to the Full Text: A similar breakdown can be adapted for every verse, sentence, or section of the Chöd text. In other passages (for example, the extended final damaru chant that includes syllables such as “DHARE, BHANDARE, SVA HA, JAYA…”), you would provide a row (or set of rows) following the same column structure.
- Fidelity & Flexibility: The provided Uchen, EWTS, and IPA renderings are intended as first approximations. For academic publication or precise liturgical work, you may wish to consult a specialist in Tibetan philology.
- Performance Considerations: The “drumbeat alignment” is offered as a textual guide. In live performance, damaru strikes are notated by both touch and timbre. Adjust the beat descriptions (“thum,” “tac,” etc.) to suit the actual performance style or your interpretive needs.

This Markdown rendering aims to integrate the textual, phonetic, rhythmic, and semantic layers of these damaru invocations so that both scholars and practitioners can appreciate and work with the complex interplay of sound and meaning inherent in the Chöd tradition.
