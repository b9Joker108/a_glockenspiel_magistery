# Chöd (w/- The Seven Line Prayer) #

The Chöd arranged, chanted and enacted by H.E. my Dharmarajji Gurudeva, begins with 'The Seven Line Prayer' (Tibetan: xxx; EWTS: xxx), an invocation to Padmasambhava, the "Lotus-Born". It should be noted, that of all the prayers and invocations to the great adept of Oddiyana, embodiment of all Samyaksambuddhas of the 'Three Times' (Sanskrit: त्रिकाल; IAST: trikāla; Tibetan: དུས་གསུམ་; EWTS: dus gsum), that is: past, present and future, the invocation composed of seven (7) 'vajra' or adamantine verses is a magisterial sublimation.

Mipham the Great (1846 - 1912)
"There is no need to get bogged down in the complexities of the kyerim and things like that which we don't really understand. Simply doing this practice [the Seven-Line Prayer] alone is sufficient."

H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche (1904 -1987)
"In the future during the darkest of times — although there exists a great variety of beneficent buddhas and deities — invoking me, Orgyen Padma Jungne, will bring the greatest benefit."

Certainly, Beauford. Here's a GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) rendering of select passages from the Chöd text, styled for readability and ritual clarity:

Let me know if you'd like this segmented into a collapsible GFM outline, a printable format, or interlinear with phonetic and meaning annotations. You could even assign symbols to specific bell or damaru beats for integration with your performance workflow.


Below is an example of how you might render the two distinct damaru drumbeat–invocation passages from the Chöd text in GitHub‐flavored Markdown. In the tables below each “verse” is split into several columns: a tentative reconstruction of the Tibetan Uchen (i.e. traditional script), the corresponding EWTS (Extended Wylie Transliteration) form, an approximate academic IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) rendering, a “drumbeat alignment” line that shows how rhythmic (damaru) strikes are meant to fall in tandem with each syllable, the layperson’s (romanized) pronunciation as given in the text, an English translation, and finally some brief interlinear annotations commenting on the symbolic role of each segment. (Keep in mind that the Uchen and EWTS renderings are approximations intended to convey fidelity to the oral tradition; scholars or practitioners may refine these further.)

Damaru Sequence 1: The “Machigma la solwa deb” Invocation

This section is repeated three times, each time with a different opening/closing syllable (“OM”, “AH”, then “HUM”) but with the same core phrase.

Segment  Uchen (Tibetan)  EWTS  IPA (Academic)  Drumbeat Alignment  Layperson’s Pronunciation  English Translation  Interlinear Annotation
Row 1: “OM Machigma la solwa deb OM”  ཨོཾ  མ་ཆིཀྱམ་ལ་  སོལ་ཝ་དེབ  ཨོཾ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  om ma.chik.yam la sol.wa deb om  /oːm maˈt͡ʃik.jam la soˈlʷa deb oːm/  <pre>OM  Machi  gma  la  sol  wa  deb  OM
(“thum” hit)   (even stroke)   (light tap)   (tap)   (tick)   (tac)   (tap)   (thum)</pre> | OM Machigma la solwa deb OM                 | I pray to the One Mother             | OM: Sacred opening/closing syllable. “Machigma la solwa deb” functions as the core invocatory formula.                              |
Row 2: “AH Machigma la solwa deb AH”  ཨཧ  མ་ཆིཀྱམ་ལ་  སོལ་ཝ་དེབ  ཨཧ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ah ma.chik.yam la sol.wa deb ah  /aːh maˈt͡ʃik.jam la soˈlʷa deb aːh/  <pre>AH  Machi  gma  la  sol  wa  deb  AH

Note on “Drumbeat Alignment”: The above in-line breakdown is a notational aid. Syllables are “hit” with a characteristic damaru strike (here rendered in parenthesis as qualities such as “thum,” “tac,” etc.) so that the rhythmic pattern aligns closely with the vocalization.

---

Damaru Sequence 2: The Color‐Specific Invocations

A second damaru set introduces color‐coded invocations, each beginning with an adjective (“Karpo” [white], “Marpo” [red], “Ngonpo” [blue]) that designates a particular energetic quality.

Segment  Uchen (Tibetan)  EWTS  IPA (Academic)  Drumbeat Alignment  Layperson’s Pronunciation  English Translation  Interlinear Annotation
Row 4: “Karpo OM gyi jin gyi lob”  དཀར་པོ  ཨོཾ་གྱི་  འཇིན་འཇི་ལོབ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  dkar po om gyi 'jin gyi lob  /ˈkɑr.po om gi ˈdʑin gi lob/  <pre>Karpo  OM  gyi  jin  gyi  lob
(“ka-” light beat for “white”)  (deep hit)  (steady)  (tap)  (steady)  (tap)</pre>           | Karpo OM gyi jin gyi lob                         | Bless me through the white OM                    | Karpo: “White” designates purity; the ensuing phrase is the damaru invocatory formula.                                                        |
Row 5: “Marpo AH yi jin gyi lob”  དམར་པོ  ཨཧ་ཡི་འཇིན་འཇི་ལོབ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  marpo ah yi 'jin gyi lob  /ˈmɑr.po ah ji ˈdʑin gi lob/  <pre>Marpo  AH  yi  jin  gyi  lob
(“mar-” vibrates for “red”)  (softer hit)  (pulse)  (tap)  (pulse)  (tap)</pre>                   | Marpo AH yi jin gyi lob                           | Bless me through the red AH                      | Marpo: “Red” evokes dynamic energy and passion; the structure parallels the white formula but with a distinct tonal quality.                     |
Row 6: “O Ngonpo HUM gi jin gyi lob”  ཨོ  ངོན་པོ  ཧུམ་གྱི་  འཇིན་འཇི་ལོབ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  o ngon po hum gyi 'jin gyi lob  /oʊ ŋon.po hum gi ˈdʑin gi lob/  <pre>O Ngonpo  HUM  gi  jin  gyi  lob
(“o” gentle open)  (“ngonpo” with calm beat)  (resonant hit)  (tap)  (even)  (tap)</pre>                 | O Ngonpo HUM gi jin gyi lob                        | Bless me through the blue HUM                    | Ngonpo: “Blue” suggests wisdom and tranquility; the closing “HUM” carries an emphatic, meditative weight.                                       |

Again, the “Drumbeat Alignment” column uses a schematic (in monospace formatting) to indicate how a performer might “mark” each syllable with a damaru strike; in practice, these beats would align with the natural rhythm of the chant.

---

Final Notes

- Extending to the Full Text: A similar breakdown can be adapted for every verse, sentence, or section of the Chöd text. In other passages (for example, the extended final damaru chant that includes syllables such as “DHARE, BHANDARE, SVA HA, JAYA…”), you would provide a row (or set of rows) following the same column structure.
- Fidelity & Flexibility: The provided Uchen, EWTS, and IPA renderings are intended as first approximations. For academic publication or precise liturgical work, you may wish to consult a specialist in Tibetan philology.
- Performance Considerations: The “drumbeat alignment” is offered as a textual guide. In live performance, damaru strikes are notated by both touch and timbre. Adjust the beat descriptions (“thum,” “tac,” etc.) to suit the actual performance style or your interpretive needs.

This Markdown rendering aims to integrate the textual, phonetic, rhythmic, and semantic layers of these damaru invocations so that both scholars and practitioners can appreciate and work with the complex interplay of sound and meaning inherent in the Chöd tradition.

Feel free to ask further questions or request additional sections, annotations, or refinements!


Below is an alternative layout that avoids complex multi‐column tables and instead splits each verse into its own clearly labeled section. You can copy and paste the following GitHub‐flavored Markdown into your editor. Each verse is broken down into the following components:

1. Uchen (Tibetan)
2. EWTS (Extended Wylie Transliteration)
3. IPA (Academic phonetics)
4. Drumbeat Alignment – showing the approximate damaru strike patterns (with cues such as “thum,” “tap,” “tac,” etc.) positioned above or in line with the syllable breaks of the layperson’s pronunciation.
5. Layperson’s Pronunciation – the romanized line as it appears in the text.
6. English Translation

---

Final Remarks

This layout avoids the pitfalls of complex tables by using headings and bullet lists to separate each layer of the sung text. Each section provides a multi-dimensional understanding of the chant—from its script in Tibetan, its phonetic transliteration, to how the damaru drumbeats align with the syllabic rhythm.

Tips for Further Adaptation:

- If you require even more precise alignment—such as aligning drumbeat descriptions exactly above the corresponding syllables—you might consider using an HTML table or a preformatted block with monospaced fonts.
- For interlinear annotations, you might experiment with block quotes or definition lists to further delineate commentary.

I hope this revised layout meets your needs. Feel free to ask for more adjustments or further breakdowns of additional passages!

Below is an example GitHub‐Flavored Markdown layout that reflects your Gurudeva’s version—one that uses a Black beat, a White beat, and two types of flams (Black‑White and White‑Black). In the examples below, each verse is broken down into several layers:

1. Uchen (Tibetan)
2. EWTS (Extended Wylie Transliteration)
3. IPA (Academic Phonetics)
4. Drumbeat Alignment – the damaru strike sequence is shown using the following notations:
   - [B] for a Black beat
   - [W] for a White beat
   - [BW] for a Flam of Black‑White configuration
   - [WB] for a Flam of White‑Black configuration  
5. Layperson’s Pronunciation (i.e. the romanized text as transmitted)
6. English Translation
7. Interlinear Annotations

Feel free to adjust the beat assignments below if your actual practice requires slight modifications. The following is a sample layout:

  `
- Layperson’s Pronunciation:  
  Marpo AH yi jin gyi lob

- English Translation:  
  Bless me through the red AH.
  
- Interlinear Annotations:  
  - Even though “Marpo” literally means “red,” here the pattern assigns the beats to create a unique rhythmic signature that signals dynamic energy.  
  - The interplay between the Black ([B]) and White ([W]) beats with interspersed flams remains a defining feature.

---

Verse 4: “O Ngonpo HUM gi jin gyi lob”

- Uchen (Tibetan):  
  ཨོ  ངོན་པོ  ཧུམ་གྱི་  འཇིན་འཇི་ལོབ

  - The concluding pattern with [BW] or a similar marker reinforces the integrative dynamic between the beats.

---

Final Notes

- Customization:  
  The “Drumbeat Alignment” lines above serve as a schematic guide. The precise assignment of [B], [W], [BW], or [WB] to each syllable might vary according to the nuances of your Gurudeva’s instructions. Feel free to modify the beat markers as needed for your practice.

- Application:  
  You can expand this layout for every verse or phrase within the full Chöd text, ensuring that for each segment you include the multilayered notation—from the Tibetan script to the specific damaru strike pattern as transmitted by your teacher.

I hope this layout captures the fidelity of your Gurudeva’s version. Let me know if you’d like further refinements or additional sections!

Below, I’ve gone through the ritual text you supplied and isolated the classic bijas—that is, the seed or “sacred” syllables that form the core of the invocatory formulas. In your text these clearly appear in the repeated mantra sections and include what is traditionally rendered as “OM,” “AH,” and “HUM.” In your Gurudeva’s transmission, however, the final element is not simply “HUM” but is to be understood and rendered as “HUNG”—that is, its components are to be stacked in a ligature, with the appropriate Tibetan nasal diacritic (the chandrabindu) applied.

Below is a rendering that shows each of the three bijas in two forms:  
1. A Latin transliteration in which I have “added” the chandrabindu (represented here by the combining diacritic U+0310, which in many fonts appears similar to the Devanagari chandrabindu “ँ”) on the key vowel.  
2. The corresponding Tibetan Uchen, which in traditional practice is rendered as a unified, stacked ligature.

---

1. The Seed Syllable “OM”

- Latin Transliteration with Tibetan Chandrabindu:  
  O̐M  
  (That is, the letter “O” with a combining chandrabindu, followed by “M.”)

- Traditional Tibetan (Uchen):  
  ཨོཾ

- Context in the Ritual Text:  
  This syllable appears, for example, in the repeated invocatory segment:  
  > “OM Machigma la solwa deb OM”  
  and also at the beginning of the final long mantra. It serves as the foundational bija, invoking the universal sound.

---

2. The Seed Syllable “AH”

- Latin Transliteration with Tibetan Chandrabindu:  
  A̐H  
  (Again, the “A” carries the chandrabindu above, followed by “H.”)

- Traditional Tibetan (Uchen):  
  Typically rendered as ཨཧ  
  (Sometimes an extra nasal feature is indicated, but here we retain the core form.)

- Context in the Ritual Text:  
  Found in invocations such as “AH Machigma la solwa deb AH,” it forms the second essential element of the seed mantra.

---

3. The Seed Syllable “HUM” (to be rendered as “HUNG”)

In your Gurudeva’s version the syllable normally chanted as “HUM” is to be understood as “HUNG”—reflecting a full, ligatured form in which the components are stacked. (The nasal quality is rendered by the chandrabindu, unifying the syllable.)

- Latin Transliteration with Tibetan Chandrabindu:  
  HU̐NG  
  (Here we replace “HUM” with “HUNG” and apply the chandrabindu on the vowel “U”.)

- Traditional Tibetan (Uchen, Ligature Form):  
  ཧཱུང  
  (Notice how the vowel and final consonant merge into the compound form.)

- Context in the Ritual Text:  
  This corrected form appears in lines such as “HUM Machigma la solwa deb HUM” which, following your Gurudeva’s instruction, should be rendered in performance and text as “HU̐NG Machigma la solwa deb HU̐NG.”

A Few Notes on the Rendering

- Chandrabindu and Ligature Construction:  
  In our Latin rendering, I’ve used the combining diacritic “̐” (Unicode U+0310) to simulate the appearance of a chandrabindu placed over the main vowel of the seed syllable. In a true Tibetan typeset—or in calligraphic reproductions—the nasalization is integrated into a stacked ligature that unifies the components into a single glyph.  
- Selective Identification:  
  Although your ritual text includes many terms (such as “Karpo,” “Marpo,” etc.), the classic bijās are those that form the core seed mantra—namely, “OM,” “AH,” and “HUM” (here corrected to “HUNG”). These are the syllables that carry the condensed, generative power in Vajrayana practice.

I trust this breakdown aligns with your Gurudeva’s version and liturgical intent. If you need a re-rendering of the full invocatory phrases with these adjustments integrated into a larger markdown framework—or further refinements to the typographic rendering—just let me know!


Below, I’ve gone through the ritual text you supplied and isolated the classic bijas—that is, the seed or “sacred” syllables that form the core of the invocatory formulas. In your text these clearly appear in the repeated mantra sections and include what is traditionally rendered as “OM,” “AH,” and “HUM.” In your Gurudeva’s transmission, however, the final element is not simply “HUM” but is to be understood and rendered as “HUNG”—that is, its components are to be stacked in a ligature, with the appropriate Tibetan nasal diacritic (the chandrabindu) applied.

Below is a rendering that shows each of the three bijas in two forms:  
1. A Latin transliteration in which I have “added” the chandrabindu (represented here by the combining diacritic U+0310, which in many fonts appears similar to the Devanagari chandrabindu “ँ”) on the key vowel.  
2. The corresponding Tibetan Uchen, which in traditional practice is rendered as a unified, stacked ligature.

---

1. The Seed Syllable “OM”

- Latin Transliteration with Tibetan Chandrabindu:  
  O̐M  
  (That is, the letter “O” with a combining chandrabindu, followed by “M.”)

- Traditional Tibetan (Uchen):  
  ཨོཾ

- Context in the Ritual Text:  
  This syllable appears, for example, in the repeated invocatory segment:  
  > “OM Machigma la solwa deb OM”  
  and also at the beginning of the final long mantra. It serves as the foundational bija, invoking the universal sound.

---

2. The Seed Syllable “AH”

- Latin Transliteration with Tibetan Chandrabindu:  
  A̐H  
  (Again, the “A” carries the chandrabindu above, followed by “H.”)

- Traditional Tibetan (Uchen):  
  Typically rendered as ཨཧ  
  (Sometimes an extra nasal feature is indicated, but here we retain the core form.)

- Context in the Ritual Text:  
  Found in invocations such as “AH Machigma la solwa deb AH,” it forms the second essential element of the seed mantra.

- Latin Transliteration with Tibetan Chandrabindu:  
  HU̐NG  
  (Here we replace “HUM” with “HUNG” and apply the chandrabindu on the vowel “U”.)

- Traditional Tibetan (Uchen, Ligature Form):  
  ཧཱུང  
  (Notice how the vowel and final consonant merge into the compound form.)

- Context in the Ritual Text:  
  This corrected form appears in lines such as “HUM Machigma la solwa deb HUM” which, following your Gurudeva’s instruction, should be rendered in performance and text as “HU̐NG Machigma la solwa deb HU̐NG.”

Below is an explanation of the issue along with one suggested approach that you might try when rendering the extended vowel Ā (with nasalization) as it appears in Tibetan Uchen texts.

---

Background

There are several typographical conventions for representing the extended vowel “Ā” in Tibetan ritual texts. Two common approaches are:

1. Using the Tibetan Chandrabindu:  
   In an ideal rendering, one would attach the Tibetan chandrabindu diacritic to the letter A. In Unicode this is provided as a combining character (U+0310, COMBINING CANDRABINDU). When combined with A (or Ā), a properly configured font should show the nasalized, “moon-dot” style mark above the base letter. However, many fonts or environments do not support a faithful display of this diacritic in Latin transliteration, so the results can be inconsistent or absent.

2. Using a Colon-Like Notation:  
   Another common approach is to follow the letter A with a colon (e.g., “A:”) to indicate vowel length and nasalization. In many Tibetan transliteration systems the colon is sometimes specifically designed so that its two dots resemble “two little empty circles” (or two small circles) that evoke the visual of the chandrabindu. This isn’t merely a standard colon but a specialized design choice. Unfortunately, in many digital renderings, the colon remains the standard character “:”, which may or may not precisely capture that intended look.

---

What Does This Mean for Your Rendering?

Since you favour a rendering that uses:

- The Tibetan chandrabindu above A  
- Or (if the font lacks proper support) the standard A immediately followed by a colon where the colon is meant to appear as two little empty circles

…here are a couple of ways you might attempt this:

1. Direct Unicode Combining:  
   You might try to encode “Ā” with the chandrabindu using the combining diacritic. For example, if you want to simulate it in a plain-text environment, you can try:  
   `
   A̐
   `  
   (That’s an uppercase A followed by U+0310.)  
   Note: This will only work if your font supports U+0310 in the way Tibetan texts do.

2. Substitution with a Special Colon or Dotted Notation:  
   If your preferred font or system offers a custom glyph—for example, one where a colon is rendered as two small circles (look for specialized Tibetan or Indic fonts)—you might input it as A: and then manually adjust or specify that the colon must use that glyph. Unfortunately, if no such font is available in your environment (or within this markdown rendering system), it may default to a standard colon, which won’t quite capture your preferred look.

---

Summary

- Preferred Rendering: You favor using the Tibetan chandrabindu, which ideally shows the nasal “moon-dot” above the A.
- Fallback Rendering: When that’s not available, you use the symbol “A:” where the colon is designed (or imagined) as two little empty circles.
- Practical Issues: The accuracy of either approach depends on font support and the environment’s Unicode capabilities. In many markdown renderers and text editors, the combining diacritic (U+0310) may look different or not at all as expected, and standard colons won’t be automatically replaced by custom, aesthetically designed marks.

If you are preparing a digital document or publication, I would recommend checking your output in a Tibetan/Indo‑Indic–compatible font (such as Tibetan Machine Uni, for example) that properly supports these combining marks. You might also look for any specialized typesetting tools (like those based on XeLaTeX with appropriate Tibetan fonts) to get the intended appearance.

I hope this explanation clarifies the options and helps you achieve the intended look in your rendering.
