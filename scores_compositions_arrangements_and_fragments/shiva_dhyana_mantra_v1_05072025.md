### Historicity and Context

- **Origin and Usage:**  
  The Shiva Dhyana Mantra, also known as the *Karacharana Kritam* or *Kṣamāpaṇa Stotra*, is a traditional penitential prayer found in the Hindu devotional repertoire, especially within Shaiva traditions. Its precise scriptural origin is not attributed to a single text or author, which is common for many such stotras and dhyana mantras[7][10]. It is widely recited in daily worship and at the conclusion of rituals as an act of repentance and purification.

- **Philosophical Context:**  
  The mantra expresses humility and the universal human need for forgiveness, acknowledging that errors may be committed through action, speech, thought, or the senses—knowingly or unknowingly. It reflects the bhakti (devotional) ethos: the devotee seeks Shiva’s grace, recognizing him as the boundless ocean of compassion[1][7].

- **Liturgical Function:**  
  Traditionally chanted at the end of Shiva puja or meditation, it is meant to cleanse the practitioner of ritual or moral lapses, thus preparing the mind and heart for deeper spiritual practice[1][7].

- **Transmission:**  
  The mantra has been passed down through oral tradition and is included in various collections of Shiva stotras, often without attribution, further emphasizing its communal and timeless character[7][10].
