Below is an extensively annotated LilyPond score rewritten in absolute notation. In this version, every note is given with its full octave designation. Remember that for glockenspiel parts the convention is to notate the score two octaves lower than the actual (sounding) pitch. Hence, although the instrument sounds from C5 to C8, the written score uses the range C3–C6. In the MIDI output we use a transposition so that the playback is rendered at the actual pitch (i.e. two octaves higher than what’s written).

Below, you’ll find several modules:
- Scales (C Major and A Minor)  
- Arpeggios (in C Major)  
- Broken Chord Progressions (adapted for two mallets)  
- A Polyrhythmic Exercise

Each module uses absolute notation (e.g. c3 rather than relative notation); then we assemble these into one complete warmup session. Finally, we create two score blocks—one for printed notation (the written parts) and one where a transposition command shifts every note up two octaves for MIDI playback.

%
% We produce two score outputs:
% 1. A printed score that displays the written notation (at the standard two-octave lower pitch).
% 2. A MIDI score that automatically transposes the written pitch UP by two octaves so that the
%    playback corresponds to the actual sounding pitch (C5–C8).
%-----------------------------------------------------------

% Printed Score: The written notation in absolute form.
\score {
  \new Staff {
    \with { instrumentName = "Glockenspiel (Written Pitch)" }
    \writtenMusicAbs
  }
  \layout { }  % Renders the printed score (PDF).
}

% MIDI Score: Playback with transposition.
\score {
  % Transpose the written music from two octaves lower to the sounding pitch.
  % Here, we shift from a reference of C3 (written) to C5 (sounding):
  \transpose c3 c5 {
    \new Staff {
      \with { instrumentName = "Glockenspiel (Sounding Pitch)" }
      \writtenMusicAbs

Explanation

1. Absolute Notation:  
   Every note is entered with its explicit octave marker (e.g., c3, d3) so that you have full visual awareness of each note's pitch.

2. Notation vs. Sounding Pitch:  
   Since the glockenspiel convention is to notate two octaves below the sounding pitch, all modules are written in the lower register (C3–C6). The MIDI score block uses the \transpose c3 c5 { ... } command to shift every note up by two octaves, making the actual playback correspond to C5–C8.

3. Module Details:  
   - Scales: Both the C major and A minor scales are defined with ascending and descending sequences.  
   - Arpeggios: Chords are written as block chords in absolute notation in 3/4 time and then repeated.  
   - Broken Chord Progression: To better suit a beginner’s two-mallet technique, each chord (I, vi, ii, V) is written as a broken pattern rather than a simultaneous chord.  
   - Polyrhythm: Two voices combine; one delivers a steady rhythm while the other overlays triplet patterns—all in absolute notation.

4. Score Assembly:  
   Each section is separated by a \pageBreak for clarity. Two separate score blocks ensure you have one printed version (for reading and practicing) and one MIDI version (for auditory feedback).

This template not only meets your requirements for absolute notation but also adapts the chord progression to reflect the broken chord style suitable for a beginner glockenspiel player. Would you like to explore further modifications—perhaps additional dynamic markings, more rhythmic complexity, or deeper explanations of any section?
