Please give me a survey of the Voodoo Blues musical artist Robert Johnson and advise of his works that would be best adapted to Orchestral Glockenspiel and my voice and why?

**Robert Johnson** (1911–1938) is regarded as one of the most influential Delta blues musicians, known for his haunting voice, innovative guitar work, and deeply emotional songwriting. His brief recording career (1936–1937) produced just 29 songs, yet these tracks have shaped blues and rock for generations[1][2][3]. Johnson’s music is marked by vivid storytelling, themes of heartache, longing, and mythic struggle, and a technical mastery that often makes his solo guitar sound like multiple instruments at once[2][3].

**Key Songs and Their Suitability for Orchestral Glockenspiel and Voice**

When considering adaptation for **orchestral glockenspiel** and your voice, focus on Johnson’s songs with:
- **Strong, clear melodic lines** that can be highlighted by the glockenspiel’s bell-like timbre.
- **Simple yet evocative harmonic progressions** that translate well from guitar to pitched percussion.
- **Lyric-driven structure** that allows your vocals to remain central.

**Recommended Works:**

- **“Sweet Home Chicago”**  
  This is Johnson’s most celebrated and accessible song, with a catchy melody and rhythmic structure that would suit the glockenspiel’s bright, percussive sound. The repetitive, singable chorus and upbeat feel make it a strong candidate for adaptation, giving your voice space to shine while the glockenspiel provides a sparkling, rhythmic foundation[4].

- **“Terraplane Blues”**  
  Known for its clever metaphor and steady, infectious groove, this song’s rhythmic drive and playful melody would adapt well to a glockenspiel arrangement. The instrument can mimic the song’s original percussive guitar riffs, while your voice delivers the narrative[4].

- **“Kind Hearted Woman Blues”**  
  This track features a more complex, composed melody compared to typical Delta blues, making it interesting for orchestral adaptation. The glockenspiel can highlight the song’s melodic contours and subtle harmonic shifts, supporting expressive vocal delivery[3].

- **“Come On in My Kitchen”**  
  With its haunting, minor-key melody and evocative lyrics, this song’s atmospheric quality would be enhanced by the glockenspiel’s shimmering tone, creating a unique, ethereal setting for your voice[1].

**Why These Songs?**
- **Melodic clarity**: Each has a memorable tune that stands out even without guitar.
- **Emotional depth**: Their lyrics and mood can be powerfully conveyed through voice and the glockenspiel’s resonance.
- **Rhythmic simplicity**: The basic blues structure is easily adapted to pitched percussion, letting your vocals remain the focus.

**Less Suitable Songs:**
- Tracks heavily reliant on guitar slides or complex fingerpicking (like “Cross Road Blues” or “Preachin’ Blues”) may lose their character when translated to glockenspiel, unless radically reimagined.

**Summary Table**

| Song                   | Melodic Suitability | Lyrical Focus | Glockenspiel Adaptation Potential |
|------------------------|--------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| Sweet Home Chicago     | High               | High          | Excellent                        |
| Terraplane Blues       | High               | High          | Excellent                        |
| Kind Hearted Woman Blues | High             | High          | Very Good                        |
| Come On in My Kitchen  | Medium-High        | High          | Very Good                        |

These choices will allow you to reinterpret Johnson’s legacy in a fresh, orchestral context while honoring the emotional and melodic core of his music[1][4][3].

My favourite is 'Cross Road Blues', it may have to be re-imagined.
