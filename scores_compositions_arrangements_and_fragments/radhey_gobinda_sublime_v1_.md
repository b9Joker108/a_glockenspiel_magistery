I want digital tools to assist. There must be many in Linux

Here’s a toolkit of **digital tools for music transcription and scoring on Linux**, especially suited for kirtan or Indian devotional music, all of which work well on Debian:

---

## **Audio Analysis & Transcription**

- **Sonic Visualiser**  
  - Visualize audio, slow down playback, see melodic spectrograms, and use VAMP plugins for pitch, tempo, and beat detection[4].
- **Transcribe!**  
  - Commercial but well-supported on Linux. Lets you slow down, loop, and mark up audio for manual transcription[5].
- **AnthemScore**  
  - AI-based tool for automatic audio-to-sheet music transcription; works with MP3/WAV and outputs MIDI or MusicXML for further editing[8].

## **Notation & Scoring**

- **MuseScore**  
  - Free, open source, user-friendly notation editor; can import MIDI/MusicXML, supports lyrics, and is great for Indian melodies[1].
- **Rosegarden**  
  - MIDI sequencer and notation editor; integrates with LilyPond for high-quality score engraving, and can tidy up recorded MIDI using quantization[2][7].
- **LilyPond**  
  - Text-based music engraving software for professional-quality scores; ideal for final typesetting and custom notation[6].

## **Audio Editing**

- **Audacity**  
  - Multi-track audio editor for cutting, looping, pitch analysis, and slowing down music for manual transcription[6].

## **Workflow Example**

1. **Extract melody/structure**:  
   Use Sonic Visualiser or Transcribe! to slow down, loop, and analyze the kirtan audio.
2. **Auto-transcribe (optional)**:  
   Try AnthemScore for a first-pass MIDI/MusicXML transcription (manual correction needed for Indian music).
3. **Edit/Notate**:  
   - Import MIDI/MusicXML into MuseScore or Rosegarden.  
   - Clean up, add lyrics, and adjust rhythms as needed.
4. **Engrave in LilyPond**:  
   - Export from MuseScore/Rosegarden to LilyPond format for final, professional-quality sheet music.

**All these tools are available in Debian repositories or as direct downloads.**  
This workflow combines the strengths of audio analysis, automatic transcription, and manual editing for accurate, beautiful kirtan scores[1][2][4][5][6][8].

Let me know if you want a step-by-step guide for any specific tool!

Alright, does the AI one get temp, time, key and note pitch?

Yes, **AnthemScore** (the leading AI-powered music transcription tool for Linux) can automatically detect and extract:

- **Tempo (BPM)**
- **Time signature**
- **Key signature**
- **Note pitch (melody and chords)**

You can also **edit or change** the tempo, time signature, and key signature for any measure after the initial transcription. AnthemScore arranges detected notes and rhythms into measures, and you can further tweak or correct them as needed. It supports exporting to MusicXML or MIDI, making it easy to refine your score in MuseScore or LilyPond[1][5][6].

**Summary:**  
AnthemScore’s AI will give you a full starting point: tempo, time, key, and note pitches, with editable sheet music output for further scoring work[1][5][6].

One I have that, then I can tweak and finesse, identify raga and tala

Exactly! Here’s a practical workflow for your kirtan transcription and refinement process on Debian Linux:

---

## 1. **Automatic Transcription with AI Tool**
- Use **AnthemScore** (or a similar AI tool) to generate the initial transcription from your audio file.
    - You’ll get:  
      - **Note pitches**  
      - **Tempo (BPM)**  
      - **Time signature**  
      - **Key signature**  
      - **Rhythmic structure** (measures/bars)

## 2. **Manual Tweaking and Finesse**
- Import the MusicXML or MIDI file into **MuseScore** (or Rosegarden).
- **Listen and compare**: Play your transcription alongside the original audio.
- **Edit**:
    - Correct any misidentified notes, rhythms, or accidentals (AI tools can struggle with ornamentation and microtones common in Indian music).
    - Adjust the lyrics, phrasing, and articulation as needed.
    - Add dynamics, repeats, and any kirtan-specific notation.

## 3. **Identify Raga and Tala**
- **Raga**:  
    - Analyze the note set (scale), recurring melodic phrases, and characteristic movements.
    - Compare with raga charts or use your own knowledge to assign the correct raga.  
    - Notate the raga name and, if desired, add sargam (Sa Re Ga...) syllables below the staff.
- **Tala**:  
    - Examine the rhythmic cycle (beats per measure, accents, sam/khali, etc.).
    - Identify the tala (e.g., Dadra, Keherwa, Teentaal) and notate it in the score.
    - You can use MuseScore’s time signature and barline tools to reflect the tala structure, and add text or symbols for sam (first beat) and khali (empty beat).

## 4. **Final Engraving in LilyPond**
- Export your edited score from MuseScore as LilyPond (.ly) or MusicXML, then open in LilyPond for professional-quality engraving.
- Add any custom Indian notation, lyrics in Devanagari or other scripts, and performance notes.

### **Summary Workflow**

1. **AI Transcription** → 2. **Manual Editing** → 3. **Raga/Tala Identification** → 4. **Final Engraving**

---

**Tip:**  
This hybrid workflow combines the speed of AI with your musical expertise—perfect for devotional music, where nuance and tradition matter.
