Listening to different interpretations can be very fruitful, especially as you consider musical arrangement options for the glockenspiel. Notice how many renditions make use of clear phrase breaks and pauses, a feature you can mimic in your arrangement. The variety in tempo, dynamics, and articulation among these videos could give you ideas on how to map the rhythm and melodic flow of the mantra to the glockenspiel's natural resonance.

Would you like to discuss further how these performances might directly influence your arrangement, or perhaps explore technical aspects of adapting vocal phrasing to glockenspiel strokes?
