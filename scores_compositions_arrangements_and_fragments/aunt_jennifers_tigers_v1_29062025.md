# Aunt Jennifer's Tigers #

Dedication: To my Mother, Rita Ivy Lynn (b. 1950) born in either Sherwood or Nottingham (as per Robin 'The Hood[lum]'), who would neither get married nor surrender her maiden name, inherited from my Maternal Grandfather, Hubert. My Grandfather was the most crafty, creative and inventive person and astute businessman and honourable person-of-quality and deep kindness and felicity, I have ever known. My Grandfather was investiture of Benevolence, he provided them all with a sublime quality of life and in his descending twilight, when his magesty and acumen faded, with malice and envy of his lived btilliance, they relentlessly henpecked him to death.
