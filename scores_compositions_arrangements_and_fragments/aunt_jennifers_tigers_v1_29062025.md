# Aunt Jennifer's Tigers #

A composition and arrangement expressive of Awe and Rage: The synaesthetic stench of moral decay, voiced in the laugter of jackals, as they predate, in pack, The Aged and briefly Solitary, Magestic Lion of the Range. An exorcism and paroxysm. The jackals, were all at-one-time-or-another workets of tapestry.

Dedication: To my Mother, Rita Ivy Lynn (b. 1950) born in either Sherwood or Nottingham (as per Robin 'The Hood[lum]'), who would neither get married nor surrender her maiden name, inherited from my Maternal Grandfather, Hubert. My Grandfather was the most crafty, creative and inventive person and astute businessman and honourable person-of-quality and deep kindness and felicity, I have ever known. My Grandfather was the investiture of Benevolence. He provided them all with a sublime quality of life and set them up in their vocations and in his descending twilight and infirmity, when his magesty and acumen faded, with malice and envy of his lived and comported brilliance, they relentlessly henpecked him to death.

Possibly a Tonal composition with lyrical arrangement and setting, a Tone Poem, with expressive poeticalily and dramatically voiced, a performative spoken-word, with The Bells, or see if a lyrical melody manifests and presents itself from the Well-of-Sound.
