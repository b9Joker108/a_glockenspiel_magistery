# Goodbye Porkpie Hat #

Lyrics by Joni Mitchell. I have secured Mitchell's 'Head' score. Need to arrange, score and engrave with Lilypond.

Here's a transcription of the song from Joni's Mingus recording in lead sheet form. The band substitutes and reharmonizes a lot so each verse Joni sings has different chords behind it. Charles Mingus was known for using a lot of dominant chords in his writing, especially altered dominants and this was the prevalent harmonic language in late 50's and early 60's New York jazz. The melody at letter B and C is derived from the John Handy tenor sax solo on the Mingus, Ah, Um album from 1959. Re: Mingus' 'Goodbye Porkpie Hat'. Please explain in detail and extrapolate.

Joni Mitchell’s version of “Goodbye Porkpie Hat” on her *Mingus* album is a sophisticated reimagining of Charles Mingus’s jazz standard, integrating her own lyrics and vocal phrasing with Mingus’s complex harmonic world. Your lead sheet transcription reflects several important aspects of this arrangement, which are worth unpacking in detail:

### 1. **Harmonic Language and Reharmonization**

- **Mingus’s Dominant Chords:**  
  Charles Mingus was renowned for his use of dominant seventh chords, often altered (with raised or lowered fifths and ninths), which create a rich, tense, and blues-inflected harmonic palette. This approach was emblematic of the late 1950s and early 1960s New York jazz scene, where harmonic sophistication and chromaticism were prized.
- **Reharmonization in Joni’s Version:**  
  In Mitchell’s *Mingus* recording, the band (which includes jazz luminaries like Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock) frequently reharmonizes the song. Each verse may be supported by different chord changes, providing fresh harmonic color and emotional nuance to repeated melodic material. This is a hallmark of jazz performance practice, especially in Mingus’s circle, where improvisational reinterpretation of harmony was central.

### 2. **Melodic Material and Quotation**

- **Letter B and C: John Handy’s Solo**  
  The melody Joni sings at sections B and C is directly derived from the John Handy tenor saxophone solo on Mingus’s 1959 *Ah Um* recording. This is a sophisticated compositional technique: Mitchell is not only setting lyrics to Mingus’s original theme but also to a transcribed jazz improvisation, blurring the lines between composition and improvisation, melody and solo.
- **Integration of Jazz Vocabulary:**  
  By embedding a saxophone solo into the vocal melody, Mitchell pays homage to the improvisational heart of jazz, and to Mingus’s own method of building compositions from the spontaneous creativity of his band members.

### 3. **Extrapolation: Performance and Analysis**

- **Dynamic Harmonic Context:**  
  The practice of reharmonizing each verse means that the same melody can take on different emotional shades—sometimes bluesy, sometimes bittersweet, sometimes dissonant or yearning. This reflects both Mingus’s and Mitchell’s sensitivity to the expressive power of harmony, and the jazz tradition’s embrace of continual variation.
- **Arranger’s and Performer’s Perspective:**  
  For performers, this approach demands acute listening and flexibility, as chord substitutions can alter the function and resolution of melodic notes. For arrangers, it offers a template for how to keep repeated material fresh and meaningful.
- **Lead Sheet Implications:**  
  A lead sheet for this song, especially in the context of Joni’s recording, is a living document: it provides a skeleton, but the real music happens in the moment-to-moment interaction between melody, harmony, and ensemble response.

### 4. **Broader Context: Mingus, Mitchell, and Jazz Tradition**

- **Mingus’s Compositional Legacy:**  
  Mingus’s use of altered dominants, blues forms, and melodic borrowing from his own band’s improvisations is central to his legacy. “Goodbye Porkpie Hat” itself is both an elegy (for Lester Young) and a summation of mid-century jazz’s harmonic and melodic language.
- **Mitchell’s Innovation:**  
  By setting lyrics to both the theme and a saxophone solo, and by collaborating with top jazz musicians, Mitchell bridges the worlds of singer-songwriter and jazz composer, creating a version that is both respectful of tradition and boldly original.

**In summary:**  
Joni Mitchell’s “Goodbye Porkpie Hat” is a masterclass in jazz reharmonization, melodic transformation, and intertextuality. The band’s use of varied, often altered dominant chords behind each verse reflects Mingus’s harmonic language and the improvisational ethos of his era. The incorporation of John Handy’s saxophone solo as a vocal melody is a profound tribute to jazz’s improvisational spirit, and the shifting harmonic context ensures that each verse is emotionally distinct, making the song a continually unfolding musical narrative.


I meant for the Mingus and Mitchell!

Here’s a **cheatsheet for arranging or adapting “Goodbye Porkpie Hat” (Mingus/Mitchell) for ensemble, solo, or analysis**, focusing on the core harmonic, melodic, and textural principles that define the piece. This is designed to help you quickly grasp and apply the essential techniques, whether for lead sheet, combo, or more orchestral/jazz settings.

## **Goodbye Porkpie Hat (Mingus/Mitchell) Arranging Cheatsheet**

### **1. Form & Structure**
- **12-bar blues** foundation, but with significant harmonic and melodic alterations[6][7].
- Divided into three 4-bar phrases; not a strict “standard” blues—expect unique turnarounds and substitutions.

### **2. Harmony & Chord Vocabulary**
- **Dominant 7th chords** abound, frequently altered (♭9, ♯9, ♯5, etc.) and substituted.
- **Tritone and minor third substitutions** are common (e.g., B7 as a tritone sub).
- **Unusual root motion:** Mingus uses root movements by third and tritone, not just fifths.
- **Reharmonization:** Each verse or chorus may have different chord changes under the same melody (especially in Joni Mitchell’s version)[2].
- **Typical chord shapes/changes:**  
  | F7  Db7 | Gb  B7 | Eb7  Db7 | Eb7  F7 |  
  | Bbmi7  Db7 | Gmi  C7alt | D7b5  G7 | Db7  Gb |  
  | B7  Bb7 | C7  Eb7 | F7  Db7 | Gb  B7 |  
  (See [6] for detailed analysis.)

### **3. Melody & Motifs**
- **Blues scale** inflections, but also angular, chromatic lines.
- **Joni Mitchell’s version:**  
  - Sets lyrics to Mingus’s melody and also to transcribed saxophone solos (notably John Handy’s solo from *Mingus Ah Um*)[2].
  - Melodic material may be derived from instrumental improvisation, not just the head.

### **4. Texture & Instrumentation**
- **Sparse, open textures**: Mingus often leaves space between bass and melody, minimal comping[7].
- **Orchestration:**  
  - For ensemble: Feature melody in sax, trumpet, or voice; support with subtle comping.
  - For solo/duo: Use chord-melody techniques, arpeggiate chords, and leave space.
- **Orchestral/arranged settings:**  
  - Use glockenspiel, vibes, or celesta for filigree and high color.
  - Double melody in upper winds or strings for added richness.
  - Avoid thick block chords—let harmony breathe.

### **5. Arrangement Tips**
- **Vary harmony for each verse:**  
  - Substitute dominant chords, use different tensions, and experiment with reharmonization for emotional variety[2][6].
- **Highlight blues inflections:**  
  - Use bends, slides, and expressive articulation if possible (e.g., in voice, sax, or even glockenspiel with rolls or dynamic swells).
- **Emphasize space:**  
  - Don’t over-arrange; let the melody and harmony speak with clarity.
- **Reference solos:**  
  - Incorporate melodic lines from the John Handy sax solo or other improvisations as countermelodies or new verses[2].

### **6. Notation & Lead Sheet Considerations**
- **Include chord symbols with alterations and substitutions.**
- **Mark key melodic references** (e.g., “derived from sax solo”).
- **Indicate optional reharmonizations** for each chorus/verse.
- **For glockenspiel or mallet percussion:**  
  - Write melody in the appropriate register (C5–C8).
  - Use dynamics and articulation to mimic vocal/instrumental expressivity.

### **Quick Reference Table**

| Element        | Mingus/Mitchell Application                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Form           | 12-bar blues, altered and reinterpreted           |
| Harmony        | Dominant 7ths, altered chords, substitutions      |
| Melody         | Bluesy, chromatic, sometimes from sax solos       |
| Texture        | Sparse, open, focus on melody and bass            |
| Arrangement    | Reharmonize each verse, leave space, use color    |
| Notation       | Lead sheet with detailed chords and melody notes  |

**Further study:**  
- Listen to both Mingus’s original and Joni Mitchell’s *Mingus* album for practical examples of reharmonization and melodic reinterpretation.
- Analyze lead sheets and transcriptions for chord voicings and melodic phrasing[2][6].
- For orchestral or ensemble settings, consult published arrangements (e.g., Hal Leonard, Alan Baylock) for instrumentation ideas[3][8].

This cheatsheet will help you quickly orient your arranging or adaptation process for “Goodbye Porkpie Hat,” honoring both Mingus’s harmonic adventurousness and Mitchell’s lyric/melodic inventiveness.

What is a 'Head' score?

A **"head" score** in jazz refers to the written representation of a tune’s **main theme or melody**—the "head"—along with its chord progression (the "changes"). This is most commonly presented as a **lead sheet**: a single staff showing the melody, chord symbols, and sometimes lyrics, but not a full arrangement or orchestration[1][5][6].

### Key Features of a Head Score

- **Melody:** The principal, recurring theme of the piece, usually played at the beginning and end of a jazz performance.
- **Chord Changes:** The harmonic structure over which the head and subsequent improvisations are played.
- **Form:** The head typically outlines the form of the tune (e.g., 12-bar blues, 32-bar AABA), which is repeated for solos and returns[1][4][6].
- **Minimal Notation:** Unlike a classical score, a head score or lead sheet does not provide detailed arrangements for each instrument; it leaves interpretation, accompaniment, and improvisation to the performers[5][8].
- **Usage:** In performance, musicians play the head as written at the start ("in"), improvise over the chord changes for several choruses, and then restate the head at the end ("out")[2][4][5].

### Context

- **Jazz Tradition:** The head is the anchor for improvisation, providing both melodic and harmonic reference points throughout a performance[1][2][4].
- **Lead Sheet vs. Full Score:** A head score is not a conductor’s score (which includes all parts); it is a concise, flexible document designed for quick communication among jazz musicians[5][8].

**In summary:**  
A "head" score is a lead sheet containing the main melody and chord changes of a jazz tune, serving as the structural and thematic basis for performance and improvisation[1][5][6].
