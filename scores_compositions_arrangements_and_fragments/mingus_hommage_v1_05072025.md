# Goodbye Porkpie Hat #

Lyrics by Joni Mitchell. I have secured a score. Need to arrange, score and engrave with Lilypond.

Here's a transcription of the song from Joni's Mingus recording in lead sheet form. The band substitutes and reharmonizes a lot so each verse Joni sings has different chords behind it. Charles Mingus was known for using a lot of dominant chords in his writing, especially altered dominants and this was the prevalent harmonic language in late 50's and early 60's New York jazz. The melody at letter B and C is derived from the John Handy tenor sax solo on the Mingus, Ah, Um album from 1959. Re: Mingus' 'Goodbye Porkpie Hat'. Please explain in detail and extrapolate.

Joni Mitchell’s version of “Goodbye Porkpie Hat” on her *Mingus* album is a sophisticated reimagining of Charles Mingus’s jazz standard, integrating her own lyrics and vocal phrasing with Mingus’s complex harmonic world. Your lead sheet transcription reflects several important aspects of this arrangement, which are worth unpacking in detail:

### 1. **Harmonic Language and Reharmonization**

- **Mingus’s Dominant Chords:**  
  Charles Mingus was renowned for his use of dominant seventh chords, often altered (with raised or lowered fifths and ninths), which create a rich, tense, and blues-inflected harmonic palette. This approach was emblematic of the late 1950s and early 1960s New York jazz scene, where harmonic sophistication and chromaticism were prized.
- **Reharmonization in Joni’s Version:**  
  In Mitchell’s *Mingus* recording, the band (which includes jazz luminaries like Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock) frequently reharmonizes the song. Each verse may be supported by different chord changes, providing fresh harmonic color and emotional nuance to repeated melodic material. This is a hallmark of jazz performance practice, especially in Mingus’s circle, where improvisational reinterpretation of harmony was central.

### 2. **Melodic Material and Quotation**

- **Letter B and C: John Handy’s Solo**  
  The melody Joni sings at sections B and C is directly derived from the John Handy tenor saxophone solo on Mingus’s 1959 *Ah Um* recording. This is a sophisticated compositional technique: Mitchell is not only setting lyrics to Mingus’s original theme but also to a transcribed jazz improvisation, blurring the lines between composition and improvisation, melody and solo.
- **Integration of Jazz Vocabulary:**  
  By embedding a saxophone solo into the vocal melody, Mitchell pays homage to the improvisational heart of jazz, and to Mingus’s own method of building compositions from the spontaneous creativity of his band members.

### 3. **Extrapolation: Performance and Analysis**

- **Dynamic Harmonic Context:**  
  The practice of reharmonizing each verse means that the same melody can take on different emotional shades—sometimes bluesy, sometimes bittersweet, sometimes dissonant or yearning. This reflects both Mingus’s and Mitchell’s sensitivity to the expressive power of harmony, and the jazz tradition’s embrace of continual variation.
- **Arranger’s and Performer’s Perspective:**  
  For performers, this approach demands acute listening and flexibility, as chord substitutions can alter the function and resolution of melodic notes. For arrangers, it offers a template for how to keep repeated material fresh and meaningful.
- **Lead Sheet Implications:**  
  A lead sheet for this song, especially in the context of Joni’s recording, is a living document: it provides a skeleton, but the real music happens in the moment-to-moment interaction between melody, harmony, and ensemble response.

### 4. **Broader Context: Mingus, Mitchell, and Jazz Tradition**

- **Mingus’s Compositional Legacy:**  
  Mingus’s use of altered dominants, blues forms, and melodic borrowing from his own band’s improvisations is central to his legacy. “Goodbye Porkpie Hat” itself is both an elegy (for Lester Young) and a summation of mid-century jazz’s harmonic and melodic language.
- **Mitchell’s Innovation:**  
  By setting lyrics to both the theme and a saxophone solo, and by collaborating with top jazz musicians, Mitchell bridges the worlds of singer-songwriter and jazz composer, creating a version that is both respectful of tradition and boldly original.

**In summary:**  
Joni Mitchell’s “Goodbye Porkpie Hat” is a masterclass in jazz reharmonization, melodic transformation, and intertextuality. The band’s use of varied, often altered dominant chords behind each verse reflects Mingus’s harmonic language and the improvisational ethos of his era. The incorporation of John Handy’s saxophone solo as a vocal melody is a profound tribute to jazz’s improvisational spirit, and the shifting harmonic context ensures that each verse is emotionally distinct, making the song a continually unfolding musical narrative.
