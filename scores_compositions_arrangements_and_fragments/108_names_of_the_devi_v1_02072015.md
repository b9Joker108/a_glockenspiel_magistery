Which is the most authoritaive 108 names of the Devi and why?

The **most authoritative version of the "108 Names of the Devi"** is widely regarded as the **Śrī Devī Aṣṭottaraśatanāma Stotram** (श्रीदेवी अष्टोत्तरशतनाम स्तोत्रम्, śrī devī aṣṭottaraśatanāma stotram) found in the **Markandeya Purana**, specifically within the section known as the **Devī Māhātmya** (also called the Durgā Saptashatī or Chandi Path). This text is foundational in the Shakta tradition and is central to the worship of the Divine Mother (Devi) in her many forms.

### Why is this version considered authoritative?

- **Scriptural Source:** The Markandeya Purana is a major Purana and the Devi Mahatmya (Chapters 81–93) is the earliest and most influential scripture dedicated entirely to the Goddess as supreme.
- **Liturgical Use:** The 108 names from the Devi Mahatmya are recited daily in temples and homes throughout India, especially during Navaratri and other Devi festivals.
- **Pan-Indic Acceptance:** This stotram is accepted across all major Shakta sampradayas (lineages) and is included in almost every major compendium of Devi worship.
- **Sanskrit Authority:** The text is in classical Sanskrit and has been preserved in authoritative manuscripts, with commentaries by leading Shakta scholars.
- **Canonical Status:** It is referenced in ritual manuals (paddhatis) and is the basis for many vernacular adaptations and musical settings, such as the one in the "Devi Prayer" video you referenced.

### Variations

There are other lists of 108 names for specific forms of Devi (e.g., Lalita, Durga, Kali, Parvati), but the **Śrī Devī Aṣṭottaraśatanāma Stotram** from the Devi Mahatmya is the most universally recognized and cited as the standard in Hindu liturgy.

**In summary:**  
The version from the **Markandeya Purana’s Devi Mahatmya** is the most authoritative due to its scriptural, liturgical, and historical prominence in the Shakta tradition.
