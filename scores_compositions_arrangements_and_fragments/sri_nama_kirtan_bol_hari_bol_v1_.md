Bhaktivinod Thakur has written this song “Bolo Hari Bolo”. This song is taken from the book Gitavali (Section: Sri Nama Kirtana Song 4). Bhaktivinoda Thakura says that please chant the holy names of Sri Krishna. Human birth is very rare and hence one should take the opportunity to chant the Hare Krishna mantra. You can chant the names anywhere and anytime. During day or during night. He also says that please leave the association of non devotees because associating with them cause hindrance in spiritual progress..
