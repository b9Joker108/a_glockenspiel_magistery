The 'Union of the Sun and Moon' (Tibetan: ཉི་ཟླ་ཁ་སྦྱོར, Wylie: nyi zla kha sbyor)[1] is one of the Seventeen Tantras of the Esoteric Instruction Cycle' (Tibetan: མན་ངག་སྡེའི་རྒྱུད་བཅུ་བདུན, Wylie: man ngag sde'i rgyud bcu bdun) which are a suite of tantras known variously as Nyingtik, Upadesha or Menngagde within Nyingma Dzogchen discourse.

This tantra shows which experience a person undergoes in the intermediate state, the bardo, after passing away. It teaches how to resolve one's master's oral instructions during the bardo of this life, how to stabilize awareness during the bardo of dying, how to attain enlightenment through recognizing awareness during the bardo of dharmata, and, if necessary, how to be assured a rebirth in a natural nirmanakaya realm during the bardo of becoming and there reveal buddhahood without further rebirths.[2]

Namkha'i and Shane (1986, 1999: p. 91) open the discourse of the 'Song of the Vajra' (Wylie: rdo rje'i glu zhig)[3] an excerpt of the Union of the Sun and Moon into the English language and render it thus:

Unborn, yet continuing without interruption,
neither coming nor going, omnipresent,
Supreme Dharma,
unchangeable space, without definition,
spontaneously self-liberating--
perfectly unobstructed state--
manifest from the very beginning,
self-created, without location,
with nothing negative to reject,
and nothing positive to accept,
infinite expanse, penetrating everywhere,
immense, and without limits, without ties,
with nothing even to dissolve
or to be liberated from,
manifest beyond space and time,
existing from the beginning,
immense ying,[4] inner space,
radiant through clarity
like the [S]un and the [M]oon,
self-perfected,
indestructible like a Vajra,
stable as a mountain,
pure as a lotus,
strong as a lion,
incomparable pleasure beyond all limits,
illumination, equanimity,
peak of the Dharma,
light of the [U]niverse,
perfect from the beginning.[5]

https://wikisource.org/wiki/Nyi_ma_dang_zla_ba_kha_sbyor_ba_chen_po_gsang_ba%27i_rgyud   This is the Dzogchen Tantra: Union of the Sun and Moon one of the Seventeen Tantras of Dzofchen. The Song of the Vajra as promulgated by Choegyal Namkha'i Norbu Rinpoche has been redacted from #161. Does this denote pecha or what? 'Union of the Sun and Moon' (Wylie: nyi zla kha sbyor) is one of the 'Seventeen tantras of the esoteric instruction cycle' (Wylie: man ngag sde'i rgyud bcu bdun). I secured the text secured from Jim Valby who numbered it: f71 and named it: nyi ma dang zla ba kha sbyor ba chen po gsang ba'i rgyud, folios153-234, a-'dzom blocks of rnying ma'i rgyud bcu bdun.

Your question covers several advanced topics in Tibetan Buddhist textual studies, Dzogchen tantra, and textual cataloguing. Here’s a detailed, expert explanation addressing your queries:

### 1. **Text Identification and Structure**

- **Union of the Sun and Moon** (Wylie: *nyi zla kha sbyor*; full title: *nyi ma dang zla ba kha sbyor ba chen po gsang ba’i rgyud*) is indeed one of the **Seventeen Tantras of the esoteric instruction cycle** (*man ngag sde’i rgyud bcu bdun*) of the Dzogchen tradition[1].
- The text you referenced on Wikisource matches the title and content you described, beginning with the phrase:  
  > *nyi ma dang zla ba kha sbyor ba chen po gsang ba’i rgyud ces bya ba bzhugs*  
  This confirms it is the correct tantra[1].

### 2. **Folio Numbering and 'Pecha' Format**

- **Pecha** refers to the traditional Tibetan book format: loose-leaf, long horizontal folios. Numbering like “folios 153–234” means the text spans those folios in a pecha set.
- Your reference to Jim Valby’s cataloguing (“f71”, “folios 153–234”, a-’dzom blocks of rnying ma’i rgyud bcu bdun) is standard for scholars working with traditional blockprints or manuscript sets.  
  - “f71” is likely an internal or collection-specific identifier.
  - “a-’dzom blocks” refers to a particular xylographic (woodblock print) edition, commonly used in Nyingma textual transmission.

### 3. **Song of the Vajra and #161**

- The **Song of the Vajra** (*rdo rje glu*) is a famous Dzogchen practice text and is traditionally said to be embedded within the *Union of the Sun and Moon* tantra.
- Your note that it has been “redacted from #161” refers to the verse section beginning at folio 161 in the Wikisource text[1]. This is the location in the pecha where the Song of the Vajra verses appear.
- The number “#161” in this context is **not a pecha folio number** per se, but rather a **page or folio reference** within a specific edition or digital text, marking where the Song of the Vajra begins in this tantra[1].

### 4. **Summary Table**

| Aspect                  | Explanation                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Text Title              | *nyi ma dang zla ba kha sbyor ba chen po gsang ba’i rgyud* (Union of the Sun and Moon)      |
| Cycle                   | One of the Seventeen Tantras of the esoteric instruction cycle (*man ngag sde’i rgyud bcu bdun*) |
| Format                  | Pecha (Tibetan loose-leaf folio format)                                                     |
| Cataloguing             | “f71”, “folios 153–234”, “a-’dzom blocks” — standard scholarly references                    |
| Song of the Vajra (#161)| Refers to the section in the tantra (folio/page 161 in the Wikisource or pecha) where the Song of the Vajra is found[1] |
| Pecha Denotation        | Yes, the folio numbering denotes pecha format                                               |

### 5. **Conclusion**

- The reference to “#161” is a **folio/page marker** within the pecha or digital edition, not a unique pecha identifier.
- The text you secured and the Wikisource version are the same tantra, and your cataloguing aligns with standard scholarly practice.
- The **Song of the Vajra** is embedded within the *Union of the Sun and Moon* tantra, beginning at the section corresponding to folio/page 161 in the referenced edition[1].

If you need a specific translation or further philological details about the Song of the Vajra section, please specify.

I have two different scores of the SotV as well. I really should make this a part of my standard Daily Sadhana in the very near future.
