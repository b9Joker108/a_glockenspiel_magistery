That was really good, but no investigate it in non-Bauddhadharma traditions.

**Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing) is often associated with Buddhist meditation, but breath awareness practices are widespread and deeply rooted in many non-Buddhist (non-Bauddhadharma) spiritual and contemplative traditions worldwide. Below is a technical, cross-cultural survey suitable for a lexical entry, with emphasis on parallels and distinctions outside Buddhism.

## Breath Awareness Meditation in Non-Buddhist Traditions

### 1. **Hindu Traditions**

- **Prāṇāyāma:**  
  In classical Yoga (Patañjali Yoga Sūtras), breath regulation (prāṇāyāma) is the fourth limb (aṅga) of aṣṭāṅga yoga, essential for controlling prāṇa (vital energy). Techniques include nāḍī-śodhana (alternate nostril), kumbhaka (breath retention), and sūrya-bhedana (right-nostril breathing). While prāṇāyāma often involves more manipulation than ānāpānasati, the meditative observation of breath (sahaja prāṇāyāma) is also practiced, especially in Advaita Vedānta and Tantric lineages, as a means for mental stillness and self-realization[6].

- **Tamil Siddha and Sant Traditions:**  
  Medieval Indian saints and Siddhas emphasized breath awareness as a vehicle for higher realization, often linking each breath to the remembrance of God or the recitation of sacred names[6].

- **Jainism:**  
  Jain contemplative traditions debate the efficacy of breathing exercises, but some sects use breath awareness as a tool for mental purification and non-attachment[6].

- **Sikhism:**  
  The Guru Granth Sahib encourages devotees to maintain awareness of breath and to remember the divine name with each inhalation and exhalation[6].

### 2. **Sufi Islam**

- **Dhikr with Breath Awareness:**  
  Sufi meditation (muraqaba) often incorporates breath awareness, especially in the Naqshbandi order, where silent dhikr (remembrance of God) is synchronized with the breath. Practitioners may mentally recite a divine name (e.g., “Allāh”) or a phrase (e.g., “lā ilāha illā Allāh”) with each inhalation and exhalation. This practice is meant to unify body, mind, and spirit in the remembrance of the divine[5][6].

- **Chilla and Khalwat:**  
  Extended solitary retreats (chilla-nashini, khalwat) may involve intensive breath-focused dhikr, often under the guidance of a spiritual master[5].

### 3. **Christianity**

- **Hesychasm (Eastern Orthodox Christianity):**  
  The Hesychast tradition, especially on Mount Athos, employs the “Jesus Prayer” (“Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner”) coordinated with the breath. Practitioners often focus attention at the heart or navel (sometimes called “navel-gazing” by critics) and synchronize the prayer with inhalation and exhalation to cultivate inner stillness (hesychia) and unceasing prayer[5][6].

- **Western Christian Mysticism:**  
  Breath awareness is sometimes used in contemplative prayer, with phrases or scriptural passages repeated in rhythm with the breath[5].

### 4. **Taoism and Chinese Traditions**

- **Daoist Breath Cultivation:**  
  Breath awareness (tu-na, “inhaling and exhaling”) is central to Daoist meditation and qigong. Practitioners observe the breath’s natural flow or guide it through the body’s meridians to harmonize qi (vital energy), calm the mind, and promote longevity. The focus is often on the lower dantian (below the navel), paralleling the Buddhist and Zen hara[6].

- **Chinese Ch’an and Japanese Zen:**  
  While rooted in Buddhism, Ch’an and Zen also reflect Daoist influences. Breath awareness (zuòchán/zazen) is practiced by concentrating on the breath at the hara (below the navel), fostering presence and mental stillness[6].

### 5. **Comparative Abrahamic Practices**

- **Jewish Mysticism:**  
  Some Kabbalistic and Hasidic practices use breath awareness in conjunction with the recitation of divine names or scriptural verses, though this is less systematized than in Sufism or Hesychasm[5].

- **Christian Breath Prayer:**  
  In Western Christianity, “breath prayers” involve silently repeating a short prayer phrase in rhythm with the breath, often as a form of contemplative centering[5].

### 6. **Technical Parallels and Distinctions**

| Tradition       | Technique                      | Object of Focus        | Purpose/Goal                       | Distinctive Feature                |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Hindu Yoga      | Prāṇāyāma, breath awareness   | Breath, prāṇa          | Control of mind, energy, realization| Often includes breath manipulation  |
| Sufism          | Dhikr with breath             | Divine name, breath    | Union with God, remembrance         | Silent or vocal, synchronized       |
| Hesychasm       | Jesus Prayer with breath      | Prayer phrase, breath  | Inner stillness, unceasing prayer   | Focus at heart/navel, repetition    |
| Taoism          | Tu-na, qigong                 | Breath, qi             | Harmony, longevity, tranquility     | Energy circulation, dantian focus   |
| Sikhism         | Naam Simran with breath       | Divine name, breath    | Remembrance, spiritual purity       | Continuous remembrance              |
| Jainism         | Breath awareness              | Breath                 | Purification, detachment            | Debated, less emphasized            |
| Christianity    | Breath prayer                 | Short prayer, breath   | Centering, contemplation            | Silent, personal phrase             |

### 7. **Summary**

Breath awareness is a **universal meditative alphabet**—a foundational technique found across Hindu, Sufi, Christian, Taoist, Sikh, Jain, and other traditions, each adapting it to their own metaphysical aims and ritual forms. While technical details (such as breath manipulation, focus points, or integration with prayer) vary, the core principle remains: **the breath as a bridge between body, mind, and spirit, and as a vehicle for presence, stillness, and transformation**[5][6].

Please tell me all about Anapanasati Meditation in as much technical detail as possible for a lexical entry in my book on glockenspiel.

**Ānāpānasati Meditation** (Pāli: Ānāpānasati, Sanskrit: Ānāpānasmṛti) is the Buddhist practice of mindfulness of breathing, regarded as both a foundational and advanced meditation system in the Theravāda, Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna traditions. Below is a **technical, comprehensive lexical entry** suitable for your book:

## Ānāpānasati Meditation

**Definition:**  
Ānāpānasati (Pāli; Sanskrit: Ānāpānasmṛti) is the systematic cultivation of mindfulness (sati/smṛti) through sustained attention to the natural process of breathing (ānāpāna: inhalation and exhalation). It is codified in the Ānāpānasati Sutta (MN 118), where the Buddha presents a 16-step method integrating concentration and insight.

### 1. **Theoretical Basis**

- **Purpose:**  
  To develop samādhi (concentration), sati (mindfulness), and ultimately paññā (insight/wisdom) leading to liberation (vimutti)[3][6].
- **Scope:**  
  Ānāpānasati is designed to fulfill the Four Foundations of Mindfulness (satipaṭṭhāna): body, feelings, mind, and mental objects[3].
- **Mechanism:**  
  By continuous observation of the breath, the practitioner stabilizes attention, calms bodily and mental fabrications, and penetrates the true nature of phenomena.

### 2. **Practice Environment and Preparation**

- **Location:**  
  Traditionally, a quiet, undisturbed place: forest, base of a tree, or an empty room[5][6].
- **Posture:**  
  Seated (cross-legged, half-lotus, or Burmese), with a straight yet relaxed spine; hands resting in lap; eyes closed or half-closed[5][6][7].
- **Preliminary Steps:**  
  Settle the body, establish intention, and bring initial attention to the breath’s natural flow[6][7].

### 3. **Technical Structure: The 16 Steps (Tetrads)**

The canonical method is divided into **four tetrads** (groups of four steps), each deepening the meditative process[1][2][3][6][8]:

#### **First Tetrad: Contemplation of the Body (Kāya)**
1. **Knowing long breaths:**  
   "Breathing in long, he knows, 'I breathe in long'; breathing out long, he knows, 'I breathe out long.'"
2. **Knowing short breaths:**  
   "Breathing in short, he knows, 'I breathe in short'; breathing out short, he knows, 'I breathe out short.'"
3. **Experiencing the whole body:**  
   "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in experiencing the whole body'; 'I will breathe out experiencing the whole body.'"
4. **Calming bodily formations:**  
   "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily formations'; 'I will breathe out calming bodily formations.'"  
   - *Note:* "Bodily formations" (kāya-saṅkhāra) refers to the breath and its associated bodily sensations[2][4].

#### **Second Tetrad: Contemplation of Feeling (Vedanā)**
5. **Experiencing rapture (pīti):**  
   "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in experiencing rapture'; 'I will breathe out experiencing rapture.'"
6. **Experiencing pleasure (sukha):**  
   "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in experiencing pleasure'; 'I will breathe out experiencing pleasure.'"
7. **Experiencing mental formations:**  
   "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in experiencing mental formations'; 'I will breathe out experiencing mental formations.'"
8. **Calming mental formations:**  
   "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming mental formations'; 'I will breathe out calming mental formations.'"
   - *Note:* "Mental formations" (citta-saṅkhāra) here refers to feelings and perceptions[1][2][4].

#### **Third Tetrad: Contemplation of Mind (Citta)**
9. **Experiencing the mind:**  
   "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in experiencing the mind'; 'I will breathe out experiencing the mind.'"
10. **Gladdening the mind:**  
    "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in gladdening the mind'; 'I will breathe out gladdening the mind.'"
11. **Concentrating the mind:**  
    "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in concentrating the mind'; 'I will breathe out concentrating the mind.'"
12. **Liberating the mind:**  
    "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in liberating the mind'; 'I will breathe out liberating the mind.'"
    - *Note:* This tetrad develops refined states of concentration (jhāna) and emotional balance[1][2][4].

#### **Fourth Tetrad: Contemplation of Dhammas (Mental Objects)**
13. **Contemplating impermanence (anicca):**  
    "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in contemplating impermanence'; 'I will breathe out contemplating impermanence.'"
14. **Contemplating fading away (virāga):**  
    "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in contemplating fading away'; 'I will breathe out contemplating fading away.'"
15. **Contemplating cessation (nirodha):**  
    "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in contemplating cessation'; 'I will breathe out contemplating cessation.'"
16. **Contemplating relinquishment (paṭinissagga):**  
    "He trains himself, 'I will breathe in contemplating relinquishment'; 'I will breathe out contemplating relinquishment.'"
    - *Note:* This tetrad integrates insight (vipassanā) into the three characteristics: impermanence, suffering, and non-self[1][3][6].

### 4. **Auxiliary Techniques**

- **Counting (Ganana):**  
  Counting breaths to anchor attention, especially for beginners[5].
- **Following (Anubandhana):**  
  Tracking the breath’s full cycle from beginning to end[5].
- **Contact (Phusana):**  
  Noting the tactile sensation of air at the nostrils, upper lip, or abdomen[5].
- **Fixing (Thapana):**  
  Sustaining one-pointed focus on the breath, excluding distractions[5].

### 5. **Progression and Integration**

- **From Samatha to Vipassanā:**  
  The practice begins as samatha (calm-abiding), stabilizing and purifying the mind. As subtlety and clarity increase, insight (vipassanā) into the nature of phenomena arises spontaneously[1][3][6].
- **Fulfillment of Satipaṭṭhāna:**  
  Mastery of the 16 steps fulfills the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, which in turn perfect the Seven Factors of Enlightenment (bojjhaṅga), culminating in liberation[3].

### 6. **Technical Notes for Musicians**

- **Breath Awareness as Rhythm:**  
  The natural rhythm of inhalation and exhalation can be mapped to musical phrasing, with attention to tempo, duration, and subtle variations—paralleling phrasing in glockenspiel performance.
- **Embodied Mindfulness:**  
  The tactile awareness of breath mirrors the tactile engagement with mallets and bars, fostering a unified somatic-mental presence.
- **Stages as Progressive Refinement:**  
  Just as musical technique is refined through progressive exercises, ānāpānasati systematically refines attention, feeling, and insight.

|                     | 10   | Abhippamodayaṃ           | Gladdening                   |
|                     | 11   | Samādahaṃ                | Concentrating                |
|                     | 12   | Vimocayaṃ                | Liberating                   |

|                     | 16   | Paṭinissagga              | Relinquishment               |

### 8. **Advanced Considerations**

- **Jhana (Absorption):**  
  Deepening stages of concentration (jhāna) can arise, characterized by progressive unification and tranquility of mind[1].
- **Insight (Vipassanā):**  
  Insight into impermanence, non-self, and unsatisfactoriness is cultivated, leading to transformative realization[1][3].
- **Non-attachment:**  
  The culmination is the relinquishment of clinging, opening the way to nibbāna (nirvāṇa)[1][3].

**References:**  
All technical details above are based on the Ānāpānasati Sutta and authoritative commentaries[1][2][3][4][5][6][8].
