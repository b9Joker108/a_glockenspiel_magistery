Here is a comprehensive survey for your Lexicon on **Received Pronunciation (RP)** and the broader phenomenon of **prestige, elite, and technical dialects** across linguistic traditions:

## Received Pronunciation (RP): Definition and Origins

**Received Pronunciation** (RP) is the accent of British English historically regarded as the standard and carrying the highest social prestige[1][3][6]. It is also known as the "Queen’s English," "King’s English," "BBC English," or "Oxford English"[1][5]. RP is not a dialect (which would include grammar and vocabulary), but an accent—focusing solely on pronunciation[3][6].

- **Coined by A.J. Ellis in 1869**, the term "received" meant "accepted" or "approved," analogous to "received wisdom"[1][8].
- RP developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, associated with the speech of the British upper and upper-middle classes, especially those educated at elite public schools (Eton, Harrow, Winchester, Rugby) and universities (Oxford, Cambridge)[1][5].
- Daniel Jones, a leading phonetician, popularized the term in his *English Pronouncing Dictionary* (1917, 1924)[1].

## Social Function and Prestige

- RP became a **prestige accent**: a marker of education, class, and authority in Britain[1][3][5][6].
- It was chosen as the broadcasting standard by the BBC in 1922, further cementing its association with national identity and elite status[1][5].
- RP is **non-rhotic** (the /r/ is dropped unless followed by a vowel), uses long vowels (e.g., /ɑː/ in "bath"), and is known for clear, precise consonant pronunciation[2][5].
- **Only about 2–5% of the UK population** speaks RP natively; its prestige comes from institutional, not demographic, dominance[6].

## Types and Evolution

- **Three main forms**: Conservative (traditional upper-class), Mainstream (standard, most widely taught), and Contemporary (modern, less formal)[6].
- RP has evolved, with younger speakers (including royals) often using a more modern, less formal version[5].
- The rise of regional accents in media and culture has reduced RP’s dominance, but it remains a benchmark for clear, neutral English[6][7].

## RP as a Technical/Elite Dialect

- RP is often taught to **actors, broadcasters, diplomats, and interpreters** for its clarity and perceived neutrality[5].
- It is the standard for **teaching English as a foreign language** and for pronunciation guides in dictionaries[7][8].
- RP is sometimes used as a "technical dialect" in law, academia, and science, where linguistic precision and neutrality are valued.

## Comparative Perspectives: Prestige and Technical Dialects Worldwide

### 1. **France: Parisian French**
   - Standard French (Français standard), based on Parisian speech, is the prestige dialect, used in government, media, and education.

### 2. **China: Putonghua (Mandarin)**
   - Putonghua, based on the Beijing dialect, is the official standard and prestige dialect, taught nationwide and used in official settings.

### 3. **India: Sanskrit and Shuddh Hindi**
   - Classical Sanskrit was historically the elite technical language for ritual, philosophy, and science.
   - "Shuddh" (pure) Hindi and "Queen’s English" serve as prestige dialects in education and administration.

### 4. **Arabic: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)**
   - MSA is the pan-Arabic prestige dialect, used in formal writing, media, and religious discourse, distinct from regional vernaculars.

### 5. **Japan: Hyōjungo (Standard Japanese)**
   - Based on the Tokyo dialect, Hyōjungo is the prestige and technical standard for education, media, and government.

## Sociolinguistic Functions

- **Prestige dialects** often function as social gatekeepers, signaling education, authority, or membership in elite groups.
- **Technical dialects** are codified for clarity and precision in law, science, and ritual (e.g., legal Latin, scientific English, Sanskrit in mantras).
- **Elite accents** are frequently taught or adopted for upward mobility, professional advancement, or participation in national/international discourse.

They are cultivated, taught, and maintained as benchmarks for elite communication in education, media, ritual, and professional life, shaping both identity and access to power[1][3][5][6].
