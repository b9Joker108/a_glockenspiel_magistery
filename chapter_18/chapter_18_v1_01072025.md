#### **Chapter 18: Ananda-Lahari: The In-dwelling Wave of Bliss**
*   **18.1. The Greater Siddhi: Sahaja-Sthiti**
    *   18.1.1. Jnana: The state of "natural being," where the peace, devotion, and aesthetic bliss of the *sadhana* period permeates all of daily life. The music doesn't stop when the mallets are put down.
    *   18.1.2. Sadhana: There is no new technique here. This chapter is a reflection on the integration of the entire path. The practice is to see the *laya* in your own heartbeat, the *raga* in the sounds of the world, and the presence of Radhe-Ballabha in every moment. The music has become you.
