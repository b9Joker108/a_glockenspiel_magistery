### Elder Futhark ###

The Elder Futhark is the oldest known form of the runic alphabets used by Germanic peoples, not directly written in Proto-Germanic but reflecting its linguistic stage. It was used for Northwest Germanic dialects during the Migration Period, predating the separation of Germanic languages. Whilst the Elder Futhark inscriptions don't directly use Proto-Germanic, many words in the inscriptions are closely related to reconstructed Proto-Germanic words. The Elder Futhark was primarily used for Northwest Germanic dialects, which include Proto-Norse and early forms of Old English. This period (roughly 1â€“250 CE) saw the Elder Futhark being used across various Germanic tribes as they migrated and settled in different regions. The Elder Futhark evolved into different regional forms like the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc in the British Isles and the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia. The earliest period of Elder Futhark inscriptions (2nd-4th centuries CE) reflects the Common Germanic stage, predating the separation of West Germanic into Anglo-Frisian, Low German and High German.

### Odin stone altar ###

An "Odin stone altar" or "Odin stone" typically refers to a sacred stone, often featuring a hole or perforation, associated with the Norse god Odin. It's believed to have been a place for oaths and agreements, where individuals would pledge allegiance or make binding promises by placing their hands through the hole and clasping hands with another. Some believe the hole was used for sacrifices in ancient times. The most prominent feature of an Odin stone is a hole, often found about two to three feet from the ground. The most widely recognized tradition associated with the Odin Stone was the taking of an "Odin Oath." Individuals would stick their hand through the hole and grasp another person's hand, symbolizing a binding agreement. Some theories suggest that the hole might have been used for tying sacrifices, although this is not definitively confirmed. 
Odin stones were considered sacred places where oaths and promises were believed to be particularly binding. 
The most famous example is the Odin Stone in the Orkney Islands, which was believed to have immense power and be associated with binding marriages and agreements according to Ness of Brodgar Project. Some suggest that the summit of Roseberry Topping might have been a high altar for Odin, possibly with a more accessible horg (stone altar or cairn) on the lower slopes. Whilst the Orkney Stone is well-known, other locations might have similar stones associated with Odin or other Norse deities. In modern Paganism and Heathenism, Odin stones are sometimes used as altars or sacred objects in rituals and ceremonies. The Odin stone can symbolize the binding nature of oaths, agreements and promises. The Iupiter Stone is comparable, though without a hallowing hole. In some areas, Odin stones are still regarded with reverence and respect by local communities. In summary, an Odin stone altar is a place where oaths and agreements were and are made, often associated with the Norse deity Odin, and is sometimes used in modern Pagan and Heathen rituals.

### Teental ###

Teental is a common rhythmic cycle (tala) in Hindustani classical music, consisting of sixteen (16) beats divided into four (4) equal sections of four (4) beats each (4+4+4+4). It is one of the most popular and versatile taals, suitable for various tempos and styles of music. The cycle is counted using clapping and waving hands, with the first beat marked as the "sum" (the starting point of the cycle). There are three claps (tali) and one hand wave (khali) within the cycle. Teental is versatile and is used in both fast (drut) and slow (vilambit) tempos. Teental is a fundamental and widely used rhythmic foundation for compositions and improvisations in both vocal and instrumental performances.

### Vilambit (Hindi) ###

In the context of Indian classical music, particularly Hindustani, vilambit refers to a slow tempo, often used in the opening section of a raga. Vilambit is one of the three (3) main laya (tempo) categories, with madhya representing a medium tempo and drut representing a fast tempo. Vilambit is generally between ten (10) and forty (40) beats per minute (BPM). NOTE: Laya, in general, refers to the regulation of musical time in Indian music. Whilst vilambit is a general tempo, it doesn't correspond to a specific BPM. Vocalists often use a slower definition of time than instrumentalists, so vilambit tempos may vary slightly depending on the instrument or voice. In Khayal, vilambit is often referred to as the "bada khayal" (big khayal) and drut as the "chota khayal" (small khayal). The word "vilambit" may also mean "slow" or "delayed" in other contexts. For example, it may refer to one of the "ornaments" or figures of speech (alamkara) in a Hindu text, or it may describe a song that is slow or not very quick.
