### Teental ###

Teental is a common rhythmic cycle (tala) in Hindustani classical music, consisting of sixteen (16) beats divided into four (4) equal sections of four (4) beats each (4+4+4+4). It is one of the most popular and versatile taals, suitable for various tempos and styles of music. The cycle is counted using clapping and waving hands, with the first beat marked as the "sum" (the starting point of the cycle). There are three claps (tali) and one hand wave (khali) within the cycle. Teental is versatile and is used in both fast (drut) and slow (vilambit) tempos. Teental is a fundamental and widely used rhythmic foundation for compositions and improvisations in both vocal and instrumental performances.

### Vilambit (Hindi) ###

In the context of Indian classical music, particularly Hindustani, vilambit refers to a slow tempo, often used in the opening section of a raga. Vilambit is one of the three (3) main laya (tempo) categories, with madhya representing a medium tempo and drut representing a fast tempo. Vilambit is generally between ten (10) and forty (40) beats per minute (BPM). NOTE: Laya, in general, refers to the regulation of musical time in Indian music. Whilst vilambit is a general tempo, it doesn't correspond to a specific BPM. Vocalists often use a slower definition of time than instrumentalists, so vilambit tempos may vary slightly depending on the instrument or voice. In Khayal, vilambit is often referred to as the "bada khayal" (big khayal) and drut as the "chota khayal" (small khayal). The word "vilambit" may also mean "slow" or "delayed" in other contexts. For example, it may refer to one of the "ornaments" or figures of speech (alamkara) in a Hindu text, or it may describe a song that is slow or not very quick.
