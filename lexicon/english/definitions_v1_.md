### Elder Futhark ###

The Elder Futhark is the oldest known form of the runic alphabets used by Germanic peoples, not directly written in Proto-Germanic but reflecting its linguistic stage. It was used for Northwest Germanic dialects during the Migration Period, predating the separation of Germanic languages. Whilst the Elder Futhark inscriptions don't directly use Proto-Germanic, many words in the inscriptions are closely related to reconstructed Proto-Germanic words. The Elder Futhark was primarily used for Northwest Germanic dialects, which include Proto-Norse and early forms of Old English. This period (roughly 1â€“250 CE) saw the Elder Futhark being used across various Germanic tribes as they migrated and settled in different regions. The Elder Futhark evolved into different regional forms like the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc in the British Isles and the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia. The earliest period of Elder Futhark inscriptions (2nd-4th centuries CE) reflects the Common Germanic stage, predating the separation of West Germanic into Anglo-Frisian, Low German and High German.

### Teental ###

Teental is a common rhythmic cycle (tala) in Hindustani classical music, consisting of sixteen (16) beats divided into four (4) equal sections of four (4) beats each (4+4+4+4). It is one of the most popular and versatile taals, suitable for various tempos and styles of music. The cycle is counted using clapping and waving hands, with the first beat marked as the "sum" (the starting point of the cycle). There are three claps (tali) and one hand wave (khali) within the cycle. Teental is versatile and is used in both fast (drut) and slow (vilambit) tempos. Teental is a fundamental and widely used rhythmic foundation for compositions and improvisations in both vocal and instrumental performances.

### Vilambit (Hindi) ###

In the context of Indian classical music, particularly Hindustani, vilambit refers to a slow tempo, often used in the opening section of a raga. Vilambit is one of the three (3) main laya (tempo) categories, with madhya representing a medium tempo and drut representing a fast tempo. Vilambit is generally between ten (10) and forty (40) beats per minute (BPM). NOTE: Laya, in general, refers to the regulation of musical time in Indian music. Whilst vilambit is a general tempo, it doesn't correspond to a specific BPM. Vocalists often use a slower definition of time than instrumentalists, so vilambit tempos may vary slightly depending on the instrument or voice. In Khayal, vilambit is often referred to as the "bada khayal" (big khayal) and drut as the "chota khayal" (small khayal). The word "vilambit" may also mean "slow" or "delayed" in other contexts. For example, it may refer to one of the "ornaments" or figures of speech (alamkara) in a Hindu text, or it may describe a song that is slow or not very quick.
