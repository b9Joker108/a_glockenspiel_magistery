### Elder Futhark ###

The Elder Futhark is the oldest known form of the runic alphabets used by Germanic peoples, not directly written in Proto-Germanic but reflecting its linguistic stage. It was used for Northwest Germanic dialects during the Migration Period, predating the separation of Germanic languages. Whilst the Elder Futhark inscriptions don't directly use Proto-Germanic, many words in the inscriptions are closely related to reconstructed Proto-Germanic words. The Elder Futhark was primarily used for Northwest Germanic dialects, which include Proto-Norse and early forms of Old English. This period (roughly 1–250 CE) saw the Elder Futhark being used across various Germanic tribes as they migrated and settled in different regions. The Elder Futhark evolved into different regional forms like the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc in the British Isles and the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia. The earliest period of Elder Futhark inscriptions (2nd-4th centuries CE) reflects the Common Germanic stage, predating the separation of West Germanic into Anglo-Frisian, Low German and High German.

### Gat ###

In Hindustani (North Indian) classical music, a “gat” is essentially a fixed, composed melody—an instrumental counterpart to the vocal bandish—set in a particular raga (melodic framework) and tala (rhythmic cycle). It’s the thematic anchor over which musicians weave improvisation, dialoguing with the tabla and exploring the raga’s colours. Typically, after an unmetered alap (exploratory introduction), the instrumentalist presents the gat in a slow, meditative vilambit tempo. Once the main phrases (sthāyī and antārā) are firmly established, they’re revisited at progressively faster speeds—leading into drut (fast) gat passages where virtuosity and interplay with rhythmic patterns take centre-stage. Structurally, most gats have two main sections:  
1. Sthāyī (“staying” theme), often in the lower register of the instrument, and  
2. Antārā (“aside” or “other” theme), which explores higher notes. These sections can be repeated verbatim before branching into improvisational elaborations—meend (glides), taans (fast runs), and ornamentations that reveal the performer’s creativity. Etymologically, “gat” derives from Sanskrit gati, meaning “movement” or “gait,” underscoring that even within a fixed composition, motion and flow are paramount. Over centuries, each instrumental gharāna (school) has cultivated signature gats — like the Maihar and Imdadkhānī lineages — passed down as core repertoire. In the realm of tabla solo, “gat” takes on a slightly different shade: it denotes a fixed tabla composition, usually cyclic and cadential, that tabla players perform after improvisatory kaydās and relās. These gats — often in 16-beat tintal — are played later in the recital at medium to fast tempos, repeated at least twice, and sometimes punctuated by tihai (a rhythmic cadence repeated three times) to signal closure. Gats thus epitomize the balance between form and freedom in Indian classical music: they give you a firm scaffold whilst inviting endless personal reinvention.

   By “fixed” I mean that a gat isn’t invented on the spot—it’s a pre-composed, memorized tune with a set sequence of notes and rhythms.  Here’s what that implies:

1. Predetermined Note-Pattern  
   • The exact order of swaras (tones) in the sthāyī and antārā is written or passed down.  
   • Every time you play the gat, those core phrases sound recognizably the same.  

2. Defined Rhythmic Cycle  
   • It’s composed for a specific tala (for example, 16-beat tintal).  
   • The cycle, the layakari (subdivision), and key sam-khali (accent) points are already mapped out.  

3. Composer’s Signature  
   • Many gats carry the name or style of their creator (e.g., “Mishra Bhairavi” gat by Vilayat Khan).  
   • That attribution stays with the melody, giving historical continuity.  

4. Framework for Improvisation  
   • Once the bandish/gat has been presented, you’re free to ornament (meend, gamak) or spin taans around it.  
   • But you always return to the “fixed” skeleton so listeners recognize the rāga’s character.  

Contrast that with the alap or jor, where every phrase is born anew in the moment. The gat’s fixed structure is your anchor—it gives you a stable launchpad from which to explore infinite variations.

### Hindustani Classical Music ###

Hindustani Classical Music is a tradition of North Indian classical music that centres on the intricate interplay of melody and rhythm. It is built upon the concept of the raga - a melodic framework that guides improvisation and composition — and the tala, which provides the rhythmic cycle. Developed over centuries, this Artform has its roots in ancient musical treatises such as the 'Natya Shastra' and later evolved through the influences of medieval Sufi traditions and Persian aesthetics. The result is a rich, improvisational system where both the performer and the audience engage in a dynamic, evolving musical conversation.

At its core, Hindustani Classical Music is characterized by its emphasis on spontaneous interpretation and deep emotional expression. Performances often begin with a slow, nonmetric introduction known as the alap, where the artist explores the raga’s contours without the constraints of rhythm. Gradually, sections like the jor and jhala are introduced, which infuse a sense of rhythmic structure and build-up. A variety of instruments enrich this practice — the sitar, sarod and sarangi, among others, stand out for their uniquely expressive qualities, whilst percussion instruments like the tabla, provide a captivating rhythmic dialogue. These elements come together within various schools or gharanas, which pass on distinct stylistic nuances through generations. 

Historically, Hindustani Classical Music evolved as a living tradition that absorbed and integrated diverse cultural influences. The migration and settlement of various peoples, the intermingling of Persian and indigenous musical ideas, and the patronage of both royal courts and spiritual communities have all contributed to its layered complexity. Over time, formal systems — such as the classification of ragas into thaats — were developed to codify and preserve this musical heritage. Today, Hindustani Classical Music remains not only a profound artistic discipline but also an essential part of cultural identity, celebrated globally for its depth, sophistication and timeless ability to evoke and convey the nuances of human and divine emotion.

### Odin stone altar ###

An "Odin stone altar" or "Odin stone" typically refers to a sacred stone, often featuring a hole or perforation, associated with the Norse god Odin. It's believed to have been a place for oaths and agreements, where individuals would pledge allegiance or make binding promises by placing their hands through the hole and clasping hands with another. Some believe the hole was used for sacrifices in ancient times. The most prominent feature of an Odin stone is a hole, often found about two to three feet from the ground. The most widely recognized tradition associated with the Odin Stone was the taking of an "Odin Oath." Individuals would stick their hand through the hole and grasp another person's hand, symbolizing a binding agreement. Some theories suggest that the hole might have been used for tying sacrifices, although this is not definitively confirmed. 
Odin stones were considered sacred places where oaths and promises were believed to be particularly binding. 
The most famous example is the Odin Stone in the Orkney Islands, which was believed to have immense power and be associated with binding marriages and agreements according to Ness of Brodgar Project. Some suggest that the summit of Roseberry Topping might have been a high altar for Odin, possibly with a more accessible horg (stone altar or cairn) on the lower slopes. Whilst the Orkney Stone is well-known, other locations might have similar stones associated with Odin or other Norse deities. In modern Paganism and Heathenism, Odin stones are sometimes used as altars or sacred objects in rituals and ceremonies. The Odin stone can symbolize the binding nature of oaths, agreements and promises. The Iupiter Stone is comparable, though without a hallowing hole. In some areas, Odin stones are still regarded with reverence and respect by local communities. In summary, an Odin stone altar is a place where oaths and agreements were and are made, often associated with the Norse deity Odin, and is sometimes used in modern Pagan and Heathen rituals.

Sāman refers to the ritual songs composed and chanted as part of the Sāma Veda, one of the four foundational scriptures of ancient Indian spirituality. The term itself is derived from the Sanskrit root śam, meaning "to pacify" or "to bring peace," which underscores the songs' intended role in harmonizing both the ritual environment and the cosmic order. Unlike other Vedic texts that focus on prose or structured recitations, the Sāma Veda is dedicated to transforming sacred verses—many of which are also found in the Rigveda—into elaborate musical renditions designed to elevate the spiritual potency of rituals. 

The sāman are not mere musical embellishments but are integral to the performance of Vedic sacrifices and ceremonies. Traditionally, these songs are rendered by specialized singers known as udgātṛs who employ specific melodic formulas and rhythmic cycles to breathe life into the ritual. The musical arrangement of the sāman transforms the static recitation of hymns into a dynamic, evolving soundscape that is meant to resonate deeply with both the participants and the natural world around them. In this context, sound is seen as a vehicle for invoking divine energies, wherein the precise melody and intonation impart a vibrational quality that is essential for achieving the rite's spiritual objectives.

Beyond their ritualistic function, the sāman also hold a profound philosophical significance. They embody an ancient understanding that musical sound has the power to shape consciousness and foster inner transformation. Through the deliberate modulation of pitch, pace, and timbre, the sāman invite practitioners into a meditative state, aligning personal consciousness with the universal harmonies. This concept of sound as a transformative force not only enriches the performance of rituals but also serves as a bridge between the mundane and the divine, reinforcing the belief that music and vibration are fundamental to the order and balance of the cosmos.

Swami Sivananda Saraswati (1887–1963), in His authoritative Commentary on the Samaveda Saṃhitā, captures this essence when he writes: “Every Sāman is a sonic yantra, calibrated to stir chakras within and evoke śakti (spiritual energy).”

### Teental ###

Teental is a common rhythmic cycle (tala) in Hindustani classical music, consisting of sixteen (16) beats divided into four (4) equal sections of four (4) beats each (4+4+4+4). It is one of the most popular and versatile taals, suitable for various tempos and styles of music. The cycle is counted using clapping and waving hands, with the first beat marked as the "sum" (the starting point of the cycle). There are three claps (tali) and one hand wave (khali) within the cycle. Teental is versatile and is used in both fast (drut) and slow (vilambit) tempos. Teental is a fundamental and widely used rhythmic foundation for compositions and improvisations in both vocal and instrumental performances.

### Vilambit (Hindi) ###

In the context of Indian classical music, particularly Hindustani, vilambit refers to a slow tempo, often used in the opening section of a raga. Vilambit is one of the three (3) main laya (tempo) categories, with madhya representing a medium tempo and drut representing a fast tempo. Vilambit is generally between ten (10) and forty (40) beats per minute (BPM). NOTE: Laya, in general, refers to the regulation of musical time in Indian music. Whilst vilambit is a general tempo, it doesn't correspond to a specific BPM. Vocalists often use a slower definition of time than instrumentalists, so vilambit tempos may vary slightly depending on the instrument or voice. In Khayal, vilambit is often referred to as the "bada khayal" (big khayal) and drut as the "chota khayal" (small khayal). The word "vilambit" may also mean "slow" or "delayed" in other contexts. For example, it may refer to one of the "ornaments" or figures of speech (alamkara) in a Hindu text, or it may describe a song that is slow or not very quick.
