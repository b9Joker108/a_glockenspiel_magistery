### Teental ###

Teental is a common rhythmic cycle (tala) in Hindustani classical music, consisting of sixteen (16) beats divided into four (4) equal sections of four (4) beats each (4+4+4+4). It is one of the most popular and versatile taals, suitable for various tempos and styles of music. The cycle is counted using clapping and waving hands, with the first beat marked as the "sum" (the starting point of the cycle). There are three claps (tali) and one hand wave (khali) within the cycle. Teental is versatile and is used in both fast (drut) and slow (vilambit) tempos. Teental is a fundamental and widely used rhythmic foundation for compositions and improvisations in both vocal and instrumental performances.
